Using LetsEncrypt CA server "certbot" requires a domain name to bind certificates.

I put in www.media.mit.edu...(knowing it would fail) just to get to the next step in software configuration.

Here is the output-

Failed authorization procedure. www.media.mit.edu (tls-sni-01): urn:acme:error:unauthorized :: The client lacks sufficient authorization :: Incorrect validation certificate for TLS-SNI-01 challenge. Requested cd17e05b919387e7acc40396a9887d64.c8fb2bd6257bb71eba1ff052ab0816fe.acme.invalid from 18.85.28.11:443. Received certificate containing '*.media.mit.edu'

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - If you lose your account credentials, you can recover through
   e-mails sent to brenden@media.mit.edu.
 - The following errors were reported by the server:

   Domain: www.media.mit.edu
   Type:   unauthorized
   Detail: Incorrect validation certificate for TLS-SNI-01 challenge.
   Requested cd17e05b919387e7acc40396a9887d64.c8fb2bd6257bb71eba1ff052
   ab0816fe.acme.invalid from 18.85.28.11:443. Received certificate
   containing '*.media.mit.edu'

   To fix these errors, please make sure that your domain name was
   entered correctly and the DNS A record(s) for that domain
   contain(s) the right IP address.
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.


So we need 
1) a domain name and 
2) DNS A record(s) for that domain contain(s) 
3) the right IP address
