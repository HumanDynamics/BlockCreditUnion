# ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN LOCATION
# On Linux the blockchain is installed in the users ~/.ethereum/chaindata
#
# Just like with Bitcoin’s wallet.dat file that contains your wallet address and keys and that you need to backup for safety reasons, 
# Ethereum also has a similar wallet file that you should have a spare copy of. With Ethereum the wallet file has a bit weird name and 
# is not just called wallet.dat, but it has essentially the same purpose and the file works essentially the same way as the wallet.dat 
# with Bitcoin and many other alternative crypto coins. Ethereum’s wallet file is stored in the data directory used by the client 
# to store the blockchain and other files, the default locations for the datadir on different operating systems are listed below.
#
#    Default datadir locations:
#    – Mac: ~/Library/Ethereum
#    – Linux: ~/.ethereum
#    – Windows: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Ethereum
#
# Export and Import the Ethereum Blockchain
# If you are moving your Ethereum installation over to a different computer or want to have a copy on another system for solo mining for 
#example, aside from a copy of the wallet file you may also want to make a copy of the blockchain, so that the geth client will not need 
#to download the whole thing again from the network. For the moment the Ethereum blockchain is not that big, but as it continues to grow 
#it can become a very time consuming task to wait for the blockchain to download over the network like it already is with bitcoin for 
example. So here is how you can also export and then import the Ethereum blockchain should you need to do so.

    Export and Import the Ethereum Blockchain:
    – Run: geth export blockchain_backup
    – Copy the blockchain_backup file to the new system (a bit over 60 MB for the moment)
    – On the new system run: geth import blockchain_backup

#You can also export and import the blockchain data from a geth console mode, however it seems that when ran inside the console it is doing 
#it much slower than the above method. The commands for the Javascript console are admin.exportChain('blockchain_backup') and 
#admin.importChain('blockchain_backup'), so you can try with them as well, but the first example should be faster.

# Deleting the blockchain 
##################################################
# IF you having problems with an outdated chain see
# http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/2746/ethereum-node-stuck-cant-sync
# you can delet it by
# Delete your old copy of the blockchain with the command:
# rm -rf ~/Library/Ethereum/chaindata

# Getting a new the blockchain 
################################################## 
# see http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/392/how-can-i-get-a-geth-node-to-download-the-blockchain-quickly
# From your Ethereum Wallet installation directory, run the command:
# ./resources/node/geth/geth --fast --cache 1024 --jitvm




##########################################################################
# RELAOD  blockchain
# IF YOU HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS YOU CAN REUMOVE THE KEYS 
# AND THIS WILL ALLOW YOU AKA FORCE THE WALLET TO  TO INSTALL A NEW BLOCKCHIN
# ON STARTUP 
#
# DONT FOR GET TO COPY BACK YOU KEY DIRECTORY
