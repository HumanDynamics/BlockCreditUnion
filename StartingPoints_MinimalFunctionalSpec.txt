StartingPoints_MinimalFunctionalSpec


StartingPoints:
The idea here is to explore what are the most basic things we would need to do a blockchain Certification services such as certification of electronic signatures. 
This is light weight and to be taken with a grain of salt. The idea here is not so much as to be a "real functional spec" but one to explore what the minimum we might do to get started.

Dazza, Adiano and I talked about set up a Certification services such as certification of electronic signatures.
I think also think this is a great place to start....

It serves the purpose of getting something useful running an building the CU, around it.

So we get the Certificate Authority Running and then look at Governance Functionality of a CU. 
I am looking into-

https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/ 

They have: founding sponsors Cisco and Akamai have renewed their Platinum sponsorships with 3-year commitment

I am working on getting that running.


After we have something that can give out certificates etc. we should look an mimimal functionality for CU in terms of governance-
(what minimal stuff do we need) to that end I have pulled some stuff from the .gov website.



FunctionalSpec-

Looking at the CU spec from www.ncua.gov it seems that there are a lot of rules. This is true even for setting up governance. 

My conclusion is that any thing we do at this point WILL NOT be "a real implementation that would pass muster with regulators". 
For example, a supervisory commitee does not need to have an implementation which CHECKS for office terms of exacatly 1, 2 or 3 years.

We can skip much of the logic a real cu would need and put in what we need to prove our point.

A Simple Credit Union:


SEE:
three types of federal credit union charters—single common bond (occupational and associational), multiple common bond (more than one group each having a common bond of occupation or association), and community.
