**Blockchain Pilot Open Source Project**


# Business Contexts
## Identity Scenarios
### Use Case: Member with Existing “Bank” Account Creates Identity Blockchain.  This is accomplished by use of bitcoin and/or ethereum blockchain wallets.

### Hypothesis: App leverages Member identity on blockchain as part of saving and/or loan transactions (minimally check balance).
## Loan Scenarios
### Use Case 1: Loan Application and Approval or Rejection (ie credit decisions)
### Use Case 2: Signed Loan Contract With Evidence on Blockchain (digital signatures and formation of enforceable contract)
### Use Case 3: Loan Servicing: (smart contract enable automated processes for one or more terms of legal contract (ie: related to monthly payments on loan and/or other terms like default & repossession)

### Hypothesis: For Use Case 2: App enters hash of contract with signatures of all parties as a blockchain transaction (like Factum) such the existence and content of the contract and signatures is publicly verifiable thereafter. 

# Technical Items:
## Conceptual Architecture: DAPP for Saving & Loan
Concept is to Build or Extend a Decentralized Application (DAPP) perhaps like an “Ethereum Wallet” that can read/write to Ethereum Blockchain AND can do some level “fiat currency” digital wallet functionality related to: 
* Saving/Checking Account (at least check balance)
* Loan Account (at least check balance and see change with each payment):
    * Explorer UI for inspecting loan smart contract 
## Assessment of Eris Tools/Resources for Smart Contracts
* Existing Eris Open Source private blockchain based resources have yet to be assessed
* For time being, Akshith is used to directly setting up projects on Test Net

## Assessment of ConsenSys Tools/Resources for Smart Contracts
* Existing ConsenSys Open Source public blockchain based resources have yet to be assessed
## Assessment of Blockstack for Identity on Blockchain 
* Remains to be done.
