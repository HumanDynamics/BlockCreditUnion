# go to aws and set up an account.

# NOTE aws has two root dashboads EC2 AND VPC. 
# all EC2 Instance aka servers get launched into a default
# vpc VIRUTAL PRIVAE CLOUD.
# so you you dont have to go to the vpc dashboard
# but if you did or needed to find it it is a seaperate
# root dashoard: under the main root page for aws you should see
# AWS Services- under the section COMPUTE is EC2 click on that will 
# bring you to the EC2 dashboard
# UNDER AWS Services- under the section NETWORKING is VPC click on that will 
# bring you to the VPC dashboard


# SECURITY GROUP SETUP
# you need to configure a security group 
# a security group is really a set of "fire wall" rules that control what goes in and out of a 
# machine. What you doe is configure the security group then latter BIND that to you EC2 instance.
# for a web server and cert server you are going to need 3 inbound rules
# http, https ssl
# under E2C Dashboadr find Network and Security then click on "Security Groups" 
# CLICK ON CREATE SECURITY GROUP
# name the securty group something like WebServer
# give it a description like allow in http, https, ssh 
# SELECT THE VPC (use the default vpc or the one you created- see above)
# under INBOUND TAB 
# CLICK ADD RULE
# UNDER TYPE SELECT CUSTOM TCP RULE PULL DOWN THEN SELCT : SSH 
# UNDER SOURCE SELECT CUSTOM (IP) {you can leave this 0.0.0.0 or change it to a spcific IP}
# In production you might want to limit ssh to a specific ip
# CLICK CREATE TO CREATE THE RULE
# REPEATE FOR ADDING RULES FOR HTTP port 80 AND HTTPS port 443


# LAUNCH AN EC2 INSTANCE
# CLICK the button LAUNCH INSTANCE
# PICK UBUNTU Server 14.04 LTS 
# CLICK SELECT
# PICK YOU INSTANCE TYPE t2micro is fine
# on the bottom right DO NOT click the button "Review and Launch" BUT INSTEAD 
# CLICK CONFIGURE INSTANCE DETAILS
# You should be on a page called Configure Instance Details
# UNDER NETWORK you should see vpc- xxxxxx (default) in a drop down menu 
# If you are using the default vpc then select it. if you created your own new vpc select that
# BASICALLY YOU ARE PICKING WHICH NETWORK virtual private cloud you are launching the instance
# into. The default should be auto selected so just use it.
# DO NOT click REVIEW AND LAUNCH but instead (on the lower right click to the next thing to 
# configure CLICK Next: Add Storage)
# YOU CAN SKIP THIS PAGE SO AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT 
# DO NOT click REVIEW AND LAUNCH but on the lower right instead CLICK:
# NEXT: TAG INSTANCE
# give the intance a key "name" such as (xxx) WebServer and a value: "Development Machine"
# CLICK CREATE TAG
# DO NOT click REVIEW AND LAUNCH but on the lower right instead CLICK:
# NEXT: CONFIGURE SECURITY GROUP
# THIS IS WHERE YOU BIND THE SECURITY GROUP (aka firewall rules) to your instance.
# SINCE WE ALREADY CREATED A SECURITY GROUP ABOVE- 
# UNDER Assign a securty group- CKICK THE RADIO BUTTON "Select an existing securty group"
# SELECT THE SECURUTY GROUP YOU CREATED ABOVE "(xxx) WebServer"
# NOW THE MOMENT OF TRUTH:
# in the lowwer right NOW:
# CLICK: Review and Launch
# in the lowwer right NOW:
# CLICK: Launch

# select your key pair
# you keypair is a file used insead of usernames and passwords
# if you made one before select it 
# if you havent Create a new one and put it in ~/.ssh 
# chmod the .ssh dir to chmod 700 to secure it.
# SELECT YOU KEYPAIR
# CLICK Launch Instances
# You did it !!! 
# CLICK view Instances to see it run

# VERIFY THE SECURITY GROUP
# CLICK the EC2 instance 
# CLICK the Description TAB and look on the right for Security Groups
# the Security Group shoud be (xxx) WebServer that you created. 



# IP (Elastic IP a.k.a STATIC IP) SETUP
# What we want to do here is create an IP adress that persits a.k.a. like a static IP
# addresss the lives even after you terinate an EC2 instance. You need this if you are
# binding to an IP Adress which has a registerd domain name. You would create the 
# Elastic IP here and give the public IP ADDRESS to the person who registered the 
# domain name so they can point the root DNS servers to this public IP Address.
# go to your EC2 Dashboard
# under Network & Security find Elastic IP's
# (if you dont have any free elastic ip set up then create one or two by button ALLOCAT NEW ADDRESS)
# (the Elastic IP addres on left IS your public ip address) {all of this may have been done for you}
# (latter you are going to bind this ip public ipaddress to a vpc VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD)

*****************************************************************************************
# NETWORK INTERFACE SETUP  This can be skiped as you can bind and ELASTIC IP ADDRESS DIRECTLY 
# TO AN EC2 INSTANCE BELOW. (I leave it here because it can be usefull)
# WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE IS CREATING A NETWORK INTERFACE AND BINDING THE ELASTIC IP TO IT
# DO NOT MISS THIS STEP
# go to your EC2 Dashboard
# under Network & Security find Network Interfaces
# CLICK: Create Network Interface
# Description Name it (xxx) WebServer Staic IP
# pick a sub net
# DO NOT MISS THIS NEXT STEP
# DO NOT MISS THIS NEXT STEP

# CLICK Yes, Create
# After you create it mouse over the Name filed and pencile will appear in which you can name it
# NAME IT WebServer Staic IP
##### YOU CAN NOW GO TO ACTIONS
# In Network interfaces- find the button at the top called ACTIONS
# CLICK: ACTIONS
# A menu appears
# SELECT ASSOCIATE ADDRESS
# THIS IS WHERE WE BIND THE ELASTIC IP ADDRESS (WE CREATED ABOVE) TO THE NETWOK CARD WHICH IS 
# ALREADY BOUND TO THE RUNNING EC2 INSTANCE
# CHECK THE BOX:  ALLOW Reassociateion 
From the pulldown select Associate Address
# CLICK THE BUTTON: ASSOCIATE ADDRESS

# EC2 INSTANCE BINDING TO ELASTIC IP ADDRESS
# WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE IS BINDING THE ELASTIC IP ADDRESS WE CREATED TO 
# THE ALREADY RUNNING EC2 INSTANCE
# DO NOT MISS THIS NEXT STEP
# DO NOT MISS THIS NEXT STEP

# go to your EC2 Dashboard
# UNDER NETWORK & SECURITY 
# CLICK ELASTIC IPs (as you did before)

# (THIS SHOULD BE WHAT YOU GAVE THE PERSON WHO REGISTERED THE DOMAN NAME)
# SELECT THE BUTTON AT THE TOP CALLED ACTIONS 
# CLICK ASSOCIATE ADDRESS
# THIS IS WHERE YOU BIND THE ELASTIC IP ADDRESS TO THE RUNNING EC2 INSTANCE

# OK NOW THAT WE ARE CLEAR ON WHAT WE ARE DOING 
# In the popup box You can select either already an alredy running by EC2 Instance OR
# A NETWORK INTERFACE (if you did that above) Select the network Interface you named
# (xxx) WebServer StaticIP 
# OR  
# IF YOU WANT TO ASSOCIATE THE ADDRESS BY EC2 INSTANCE GO BACK TO EC2 DASHBOARD 
# AND GET THE INSTANCE ID and select it here.
# NOW UNDER PRIVATE IP ADDRESS CLICK REASOCIATION (NEW INSTANCE SO IT SHOULD NOT MATTER)
# NOW CLICK Associate to bind the Elastic IP Address to the running EC2 Instance

# Pat your self on the back- You have given the EC2 INSTANCE A PUBLIC IP ADDRESS
************************************



# VERIFY THE PUBLIC IP ADDRESS
# CLICK the Description TAB and look on the right for Elastic IP
# if that has a dash  and No IP address you missed a step and the
# server was assigned a random public ip address  
# YOU CAN CORRECT THIS BY GOING TO THE EC2 DASHBOARD
# UNDER NETWORK & SECURITY
# CLICK Network Interfaces
# FIND THE INTERFACE ASSOCIATED WITH (xxx) WebServer
# Click the radio button to select it.
# AT THE TOP OF THE NEWTWORK INTERFACE PAGE IS A BUTTON CALLED ACTIONS
# CLICK ACTIONS
# on the menu select DISASSOCIATE ADDRESS
# CLICK Yes, Disassociate 

# Test from a webrowser
# Go to a webserver an type in the ELASTIC IP ADDRESS
# Since you dont have a web server you cant connect 

# YOU CAN TEST IF THE PORTS ARE ACCESSABLE 
nmap -p 22  foo.com
nmap -p 80  foo.com
nmap -p 443 foo.com

# if you can also test by ip-
nmap -p 22  52.204.104.16
#port 22 is ssh which should be oppen
# since you have not set up a webserver yet port 80 may report closed.

# NEXT LOG INTO THE MACHINE's CLI Command Line Interface
# And we are going to install a web server!
