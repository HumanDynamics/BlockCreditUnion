1.Ti=Purpose

This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable laws governing conflicts of interest applicable to nonprofit corporations.  The procedures set forth in this policy shall be used for all actual or potential conflicts of interest transactions that the Corporation proposes to undertake, including any compensation arrangement between the Corporation and an interested person.
