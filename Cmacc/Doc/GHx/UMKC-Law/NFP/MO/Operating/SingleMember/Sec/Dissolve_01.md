2.1.sec=Upon the decision to dissolve, the {Company} shall continue solely for the purposes of winding up its affairs in an orderly manner, satisfying the claims of its creditors, and liquidating its assets, and the {Member/Manager} shall not take any action that is inconsistent with or unnecessary to the winding up of the {Company}'s business and affairs.

As soon as reasonably practical after the occurrence of a {Liquidation_Event}, the {Winding-Up_Person} shall file a notice of winding up and take such other actions as are required under the {Act} to dispose or make provision for the known and unknown claims against the {Company}.  After filing the notice of winding up, the {Winding-Up_Person} shall take full account of the {Company}'s liabilities and business property, cause business property to be liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value thereof, and shall cause the proceeds therefrom and any other assets and funds of the {Company} (collectively, the "Dissolution Proceeds"), to the extent sufficient therefor, to be applied and distributed in the following order:

2.2.1.sec=First, to the payment of the {Company}'s known debts and liabilities, but if the amount available therefor shall be insufficient, then pro rata on account thereof; and

2.2.2.sec=Then, the balance, if any, less such reserves ("Dissolution Reserves") as the {Winding-Up_Person} reasonably determines are necessary or appropriate for anticipated or contingent expenses of the {Company}, shall be distributed to the {Member}.

2.3.sec=To the extent the {Winding-Up_Person} subsequently determines Dissolution Reserves (or any part thereof) to be unnecessary for {Company} expenses, she/he/it shall cause such amounts to be distributed or paid to the {Member}, or other Persons who would have received the proceeds comprising such Dissolution Reserves under this Section as if such proceeds had not been used to fund Dissolution Reserves.

2.4.sec=When all of the {Company}'s property and assets have been applied and/or distributed as provided in this Section, the {Winding-Up_Person} shall file articles of termination as provided in the {Act} and take such other actions as may be necessary to cause the {Company} to withdraw from all jurisdictions where the {Company} is then authorized to transact business.  The {Winding-Up_Person} shall not receive any compensation for any services performed pursuant to this Section.
