[STUDENTS: ADJUST ACCORDING TO YOUR CLIENT’S NEEDS.

=Section 4.  Board Action.  Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the Directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the Board of Directors, unless the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws or provisions of law require a greater percentage or different voting rules for approval of a matter by the Board.

=Section 5. Rule of Order.  [OPTIONAL] Robert’s Rules of Order shall be used to conduct meetings of the Board of Directors.  [THESE ARE NOT LEGALLY REQUIRED, AND SOME ORGANIZATIONS WILL FIND THEM TOO FORMAL.]

Meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any time without notice if all the Directors are present, or if those not present waive notice of the meeting in writing before or after the time of said meeting.

=Article IX	Fiscal Operations

=	Section 1.  Fiscal Year.  The fiscal year shall be from MONTH1 1st through MONTH2 30th/31st.  [STUDENTS: CONSIDER YOUR CLIENT’S ACTIVITIES:  AN ORGANIZATION WITH A SCHOOL-YEAR-LIKE CALENDAR MIGHT PREFER A FISCAL (7/1-6/30) YEAR, WHEREAS OTHERS MIGHT PREFER A CALENDAR YEAR.]

Every Director or his or her agent or attorney shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect and copy all books, records and documents of every kind and to inspect the physical properties of the Corporation and shall have such other rights to inspect the books, records and properties of the Corporation as may be required under the Articles of Incorporation, or other provisions of the Bylaws or other law.

=Article XII	Amendment

=Article XIII      Indemnification

=	The Corporation shall, to the extent legally permissible under the laws of the State of Missouri and only to the extent that the status of the Corporation as an exempt organization is not affected thereby, indemnify any person which was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

=The Corporation shall, to the extent legally permissible under the laws of the State of Missouri and only to the extent that the status of the Corporation as an exempt organization is not affected thereby, indemnify any person which was or is a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against expenses including attorneys’ fees, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability and in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem proper.

=	Any indemnification by the Corporation, unless ordered by a court, shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard set forth in this Article XIII.  The determination shall be made by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding, or if such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.

=	Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, or proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee, or agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as herein authorized and as authorized by the laws of the State of Missouri.

=	The right of indemnification hereby provided shall not be exclusive if it affects any other rights to which any director or officer may be entitled by bylaw, agreement, vote of disinterested directors, or otherwise.  Nothing contained herein shall affect any rights to indemnification to which corporate personnel other than directors or officers may be entitled to by bylaw, agreement, vote of disinterested directors, or otherwise.  As used in this provision, the terms “directors” and “officers” include their respective heirs, executors, and administrators.

=	The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article XIII of the laws of the State of Missouri.

=Article XIV      Statement of Non-Discrimination

=	The Corporation allows participation in its activities, services, events and programs by persons of any race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or gender. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or gender [ADD SEXUAL ORIENTATION?]. 

=Article XV	Construction and Terms

=	 If there is any conflict between the provisions of these Bylaws and the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation shall govern.

=	Should any of the provisions or portions of these Bylaws be held unenforceable or invalid for any reason, the remaining provisions and portions of these Bylaws shall be unaffected by such holding.

=	All references in these Bylaws to a section or sections of the Internal Revenue Code shall be to such sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended from time to time, or to corresponding provisions of any future federal tax code.
