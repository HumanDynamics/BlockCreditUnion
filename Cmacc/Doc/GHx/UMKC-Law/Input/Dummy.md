Note=In an XWiki-like rendering - the missing fields can be clicked and filled in.  That is not as good (in this use) as having text fields.  The system could know to render missing fields as text fields if they were either bracketed with something <input>{Name.Full}</input> or used a naming convention like {INPUT:Name.Full}.  The first solution seems better.
