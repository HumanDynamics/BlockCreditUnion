1.Ti=ARTICLE 1: DEFINITIONS

1.1.sec=“Circulation Draft Technical Specification” shall mean a draft or release of a Draft Technical Specification circulated to the Participants after the Initial Draft Technical Specification and before the Final Draft Technical Specification. No IPR Review Period is associated with a Circulation Draft Technical Specification.

1.2.sec=“Draft Technical Specification” shall mean a document in draft or non-final form being worked on by a Work Group prior to adoption by the Members as an Organization Recommendation Technical Specification that contains a set of technical criteria (including reference to existing specifications and protocols).

1.3.sec=“Final Draft Technical Specification” shall mean a Draft Technical Specification formally submitted to the Membership for adoption. An IPR Review Period is associated with a Final Draft Technical Specification.

1.4.sec="Fully Compliant Implementation" shall mean: (a) an implementation of a Organization Recommendation Technical Specification which supports or implements all of the portions of that Organization Recommendation Technical Specification defined by that Organization Recommendation Technical Specification as being "Required"; or (b) an implementation of an optional portion of a Organization Recommendation Technical Specification or optional Organization Recommendation Technical Specification which supports all portions defined by that optional portion of the Organization Recommendation Technical Specification or that optional Organization Recommendation Technical Specification as being "Required"; and, in each instance, (c) an implementation of all portions of a Organization Recommendation Technical Specification required for a specific type of product or component thereof.

1.5.sec=“Initial Draft Technical Specification” shall mean the first draft or release of a Draft Technical Specification circulated to the Participants. An IPR Review Period is associated with an Initial Draft Technical Specification.

1.6.sec=“IPR Review Period” shall have the meaning set forth in Section 5.1.

1.7.sec="Necessary Claims" shall mean those claims of all patents, pending patent applications and utility models, regardless of when issued or effective, under which a party, or its Subsidiaries has the right to grant licenses of the scope contemplated herein, all to the extent and only to the extent that the party, or its Subsidiaries, has the right to grant such licenses as of the date of any license to be entered into with the other party(ies) as contemplated in Section 4.1, and which are necessarily infringed by a Fully Compliant Implementation of a specific Organization Recommendation Technical Specification approved by the Members, where such infringement could not have been avoided by another technically feasible non-infringing implementation of such Organization Recommendation Technical Specification. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Necessary Claims do not include any claims other than those set forth above even if contained in the same patent as Necessary Claims.

1.8.sec=“Review Draft Technical Specification” shall mean a draft or release of a Draft Technical Specification circulated to the Participants after the Initial Draft Technical Specification and before the Final Draft Technical Specification.

4.0.sec=If and to the extent a specific Organization Recommendation Technical Specification includes any Licensed Materials or is subject to any Necessary Claims of a Participant, the Participants grant licenses as follows:

4.1.sec=Except as otherwise provided in Article 6, each Participant (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) hereby covenants to grant to any other person or legal entity (whether or not such person or entity is also a Participant) a no-fee, royalty-free, nonexclusive, nontransferable, license under its Necessary Claims to implement the specific Organization Recommendation Technical Specification from a Work Group of which the Participant was a member when the Organization Recommendation Technical Specification was released by the Work Group, but only to the extent needed to be a Fully Compliant Implementation, and to make, use, import, sell, promote or otherwise distribute, directly and indirectly, the resulting implementation, which license may be made subject to the condition that those who seek licenses under this Section 4.1(a) agree to grant reciprocal, no-fee, royalty-free, non-exclusive, nontransferable licenses under their Necessary Claims to such Participant and all other parties necessary to implement the specific Organization Recommendation Technical Specification as a Fully Compliant Implementation. Except as set forth herein, the negotiation of licenses pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) shall be left to the parties concerned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Participant shall be required to grant a license pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) with respect to; ( i ) any enabling technologies that may be necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with an Organization Recommendation Technical Specification, but are not themselves expressly set forth in that Organization Recommendation Technical Specification (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing technology, compiler technology, object oriented technology, basic operating system technology, database technology, etc.); (ii) the implementation of other Recommendations, even if referred to in a Organization Recommendation Technical Specification; or (iii) any portion of any product and any combinations thereof the sole purpose or function of which is not required in order to be a Fully Compliant Implementation of an Organization Recommendation Technical Specification.

4.2.sec=With respect to Necessary Claims that pertain to a specific Organization Recommendation Technical Specification from a Work Group of which the Participant was not a member when the Organization Recommendation Technical Specification was released by the Work Group, but where an individual acting on Participant’s behalf Contributed Licensed Materials, any Necessary Claims relevant to such Contributed Licensed Materials are to be licensed under Section 4.1(a) above.

4.3.sec=With respect to Necessary Claims that pertain to a specific Organization Recommendation Technical Specification from a Work Group of which the Participant was not a member when the Organization Recommendation Technical Specification was released by the Work Group, where a draft of the Organization Recommendation Technical Specification had completed an IPR Review Period while such Participant was a member of the respective Work Group and where Necessary Claims were present in such draft of the Organization Recommendation Technical Specification, such Necessary Claims are to be licensed under Section 4.1(a) above.

4.4.sec=Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Article 4, including Section 4.1, use and license rights to the United States Government’s interest in any applicable patent rights developed in whole or part by its employees or contractors are subject to and governed by Federal law and regulation. Terms of this Option are applicable to Federal employees, agencies, or contractors to the extent that they do not conflict with Federal law or regulation, and if Participant is a Federal agency or contractor it agrees to use its best efforts to exercise whatever discretion granted to it by Federal law and regulation to make such patent rights available on terms consistent with the principles of this Option.

6.1.4.sec=If a Draft Technical Specification is modified in response to a Necessary Claims Disclosure Notice, then the notifying Participant shall have 45 days from the date on which the modified Technical Specification is provided to that Participant to againsubmit a Necessary Claims Disclosure Notice to the Work Group Chair.

6.1.5.sec=A Participant cannot withdraw from the Section 4.1(a) grant any Necessary Claims that were relevant to a previously circulated Draft Technical Specification that were not identified in a Necessary Claims Disclosure Notice during the applicable IPR Review Period.

6.1.6.sec=A Participant also cannot exercise its rights under this Section 6.1 with respect to Necessary Claims that pertain to Licensed Materials where any individual acting on the Participant’s behalf Contributed such Licensed Materials, except when the Participant’s Necessary Claims have been declared with specificity required by Section 6.1(a)(ii) by the Participant upon the Contribution of such Licensed Materials.

6.1.=[Z/ol-a/s6]

6.2.sec=For each Necessary Claim withdrawn according to Section 6.1, each Participant (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) hereby covenants to grant to any other person or legal entity (whether or not such person or entity is also a Participant) a fair, reasonable, nondiscriminatory, nonexclusive, nontransferable, license under such Necessary Claims to implement the specific Organization Recommendation Technical Specification from a Work Group, but only to the extent needed to be a Fully Compliant Implementation, and to make, use, import, sell, promote or otherwise distribute the resulting implementation, which license may be made subject to the condition that those who seek licenses under this Section 6.2 agree to grant reciprocal, fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory, non-exclusive, nontransferable licenses under their Necessary Claims to such Participant and all other parties necessary to implement the specific Organization Recommendation Technical Specification as a Fully Compliant Implementation. Except as set forth herein, the negotiation of licenses pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be left to the parties concerned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Participant shall be required to grant a license pursuant to this Section 6.2 with respect to; ( i ) any enabling technologies that may be necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with an Organization Recommendation Technical Specification, but are not themselves expressly set forth in that Organization Recommendation Technical Specification (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing technology, compiler technology, object oriented technology, basic operating system technology, database technology, etc.); (ii) the implementation of other Recommendations, even if referred to in an Organization Recommendation Technical Specification; or (iii) any portion of any product and any combinations thereof the sole purpose or function of which is not required in order to be a Fully Compliant Implementation of an Organization Recommendation Technical Specification.

6.3.0.sec=NCCI shall be governed by the following provisions.

6.3.1.sec=Unless and until NCCI is made available to the public through the processes set forth herein or established by the Leadership Council, each Participant (except the owner or authorized licensor) shall use the same degree of care and discretion it uses to avoid disclosure of its own confidential information not to disclose such NCCI to any entity or person who is not a Participant engaged in the activities for which such NCCI was provided.

6.3.2.sec=The obligation of confidentiality set forth in this Section 6.3 shall expire three (3) years from the date the NCCI is first disclosed to the Participant, and shall not apply to any information which: ( i ) is or becomes publicly available other than by the Participant's breach of a duty; (ii) is rightfully received from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; (iii) is rightfully known by the Participant without any limitation on disclosure prior to its receipt; (iv) is independently developed by the Participant without use of the NCCI; or (v) is released for disclosure by the Participant with the disclosing party's written consent.

6.3.3.sec=Disclosure of NCCI is not prohibited if prior notice is given to its owner and if such disclosure is (a) compelled pursuant to a legal proceeding or (b) otherwise required by law; provided, however, that the party proposing to make such disclosure will first have made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order or to have informed the owner of the NCCI so as to allow it a reasonable opportunity to seek such an order.

6.3.4.sec=Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Participant shall be free to use the residuals of NCCI for any purpose including use in the development, manufacture, marketing and maintenance of its products and services, subject only to the obligations herein with respect to disclosure of such NCCI. The term “residuals” means that NCCI in non-tangible form, which may be retained in the memories of individuals who have had rightful access to such NCCI under this Article 6. It is understood that receipt of NCCI under this Article 6 shall not create any obligation in any way limiting or restricting the assignment and/or reassignment of any employees of a Participant within Participant’s organization. However, this Section 6.3(d) shall not be deemed to grant to any party a license under the other party’s copyrights or patents.

6.3.5.sec=Any NCCI disclosed to the Work Group Chair shall not be further disclosed except on a need-to-know basis, for example, to other select members (or their agents) of the Work Group responsible for the Draft Technical Specification in question or legal counsel in order to assess the feasibility and prudence of revising a Draft Technical Specification to avoid Necessary Claims identified in a Necessary Claims Disclosure Notice. This Agreement is not intended to prevent a party receiving NCCI from using NCCI Residual Knowledge, subject to any valid patents and copyrights of the owner of such NCCI. NCCI Residual Knowledge means NCCI that is retained in the unaided memories of the receiving party’s employees or agents who have had access to NCCI.

7.Ti=ARTICLE 7: DISTRIBUTION OF DRAFT SPECIFICATIONS

7.1.sec=A Work Group may decide by Work Group vote to circulate interim drafts or releases of Draft Technical Specifications to Participants for review and comment. Such Draft Technical Specifications shall be designated Initial, Circulation, Review or Final by the Work Group.

7.2.sec=In addition, a Work Group may request that a Draft Technical Specification be circulated for review by and comment from non-Participants. This request, along with the associated Draft Technical Specification, shall be formally submitted to the Leadership Council and upon a Simple Majority vote by the Leadership Council, shall be published.

7.3.sec=The primary deliverable of a Work Group may be a Final Draft Technical Specification on the subject matter or undertaking assigned to such Work Group, which drafts or proposals shall be formally submitted to the Leadership Team. When the Work Group, by a Supermajority vote of the members, reports to the Leadership Council that a Final Draft Technical Specification proposed for final approval is complete, or at any other time upon a Simple Majority vote of the Leadership Council, the Board will take steps to have the Members vote to accept or reject the Final Draft Technical Specification as set forth herein. To adopt the Final Draft Technical Specification, written notice (which shall include a copy of the Final Draft Technical Specification) shall be sent to all Members advising that a vote will be held for the purposes of adopting such Final Draft Technical Specification. Such vote shall take place no sooner than forty-five (45) days after submission to the Members of the Final Draft Specification. Adoption of the Final Draft Technical Specification, or any update to an Organization Recommendation Technical Specification, requires approval by a Supermajority of those Voting of the Members. Such Organization Recommendation Technical Specification shall be made publicly available by the Members upon adoption.

7.4.sec=After any Organization Recommendation Technical Specification has been approved in accordance with Section 7.3 above, any updates or alterations thereto shall be treated as a proposal to develop a new Technical Specification and shall be subject to the same processes and procedures used for development as set forth above. The adoption of new Organization Recommendation Technical Specifications shall not terminate any right or obligation of any Participant, including any licenses or covenants granted or received by a Participant with respect to any earlier adopted Organization Recommendation Technical Specifications.
