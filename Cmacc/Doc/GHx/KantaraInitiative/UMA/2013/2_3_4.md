Title={Resource_Server_Operator}-{Requesting_Party}: Give-Accurate-Access

Condition=When the {Resource_Server} responds in any fashion to a {Client}'s access request

Parties=the {Resource_Server_Operator} gains an obligation to the {Requesting_Party}

Duty=to give accurate access to the protected resource according to whether the {Requesting_Party} has permission to do so

Comments=The {Resource_Server_Operator}, as a {Subject} that is otherwise potentially not obligated to the {Authorization_Server_Operator}, carries a great deal of responsibility here to make every effort to grant access where the {Authorization_Server} has associated authorization data to guide access. Its interpretation of scopes and permissions, particularly in the case where the {RPT} presented by the {Client} uses the "bearer" {RPT} profile, is not entirely auditable by the requester or {Authorization_Server}. Further, issues can arise from the skew between permission validity periods and actual access. Defining and using different {RPT} profiles can mitigate the risk of failure on the {Resource_Server_Operator}'s part.

Issues=The relying party traditionally always has the right of refusal. The resource server may have additional authorization context available only to it that suggests it should not grant access, for example. Should this obligation be struck?
