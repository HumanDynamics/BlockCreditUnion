1.0.sec=The [UETA] defines two terms that are particularly relevant to understanding the interactions among {UMA} participants:

1.1.sec="'Automated transaction' means a transaction conducted or performed, in whole or in part, by electronic means or electronic records, in which the acts or records of one or both parties are not reviewed by an individual in the ordinary course in forming a contract, performing under an existing contract, or fulfilling an obligation required by the transaction."

1.2.sec="'Electronic agent' means a computer program or an electronic or other automated means used independently to initiate an action or respond to electronic records or performances in whole or in part, without review or action by an individual."

2.sec=Where a {Client} is used by a human {Requesting_Party} or a human {Requesting_Party_Agent}, at times human-computer interaction (HCI) will be required, but otherwise the access-attempt transaction is likely to be fully automatic from the perspective of the "requesting side". Furthermore, where the {Authorizing_Party} and the {Requesting_Party} are the same natural person, or where the {Authorizing_Party} has set a policy that requires real-time approval through some out-of-band method, this person can expect to engage in HCI. Otherwise the access-attempt transaction is likely to be fully automatic from the perspective of the "authorizing side" because the access attempt is made without any requirement for the {Authorizing_Party} to be present at run time.

3.0.sec=The National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace [NSTIC] defines some terms similar to those defined here:

3.1.sec="An individual is a person engaged in an online transaction. {Individuals} are the first priority of the Strategy."

3.2.sec="A non-person entity ({NPE}) may also require authentication in the Identity Ecosystem. {NPE}s can be organizations, hardware, networks, software, or services and are treated much like individuals within the Identity Ecosystem. {NPE}s may engage in or support a transaction."

3.3.sec="The subject of a transaction may be an individual or an {NPE}."

4.sec={UMA} shares with NSTIC a priority to enable and empower individual people in the context of their online interactions. Note that this framework uses the terms {Individual}, {NPE}, and {Subject} exclusively for parties that have the capacity to take on contractual obligations, distinguishing them "from hardware, networks, software, or services", which do not have this capacity.
