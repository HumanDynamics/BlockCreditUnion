Title={Resource_Server_Operator} to {Authorizing_Party} and {Authorization_Server_Operator}: Register-Accurately-and-Timely

Condition=For the period that the {Resource_Server_Operator} and {Authorizing_Party} have mutually agreed to serve in these respective roles for each other, in the context of a particular {Authorization_Server_Operator}

Parties=the {Resource_Server_Operator} gains an obligation to the {Authorizing_Party} and the {Authorization_Server_Operator}

Duty=to register resource set descriptions accurately and timely and according to the {Authorizing_Party}â€™s expressed instructions for protection if any

Comments=The original condition was "When the {Authorization_Server} issues a {PAT} to the {Resource_Server} and as long as the {PAT} is valid". That is, it relied on an action that involved token issuance. We now suspect this is too specific, though in dynamic introduction by the {Authorizing_Party}, this might well be the time. The original commentary on this condition was "At a later stage, the {Resource_Server} has the opportunity to register resource sets, but its responsibility for performing this task begins now. The {Resource_Server_Operator} may have contracted with the {Authorizing_Party} for service-level agreements to respond specifically to timeliness needs and so on. This obligation can be removed through {PAT} revocation."
