Ti=Policy

0.sec=This section specifies principles and matters that do not fall neatly into either technical or organizational.  

1.Ti=Shard, guard, discard, recharge.
 
1.1.sec=We request only information that is necessary to the expected course of action and to branches where it is impractical to request additional information.  In our internal operations, we compartmentalize information so that we do not needlessly aggregate collections of it or provide unneeded access internally. 

1.2.sec=We diligently protect information using community best practices and updating frequently. 

1.3.sec=We discard information when it is no longer needed.

1.4.sec=Instead of needlessly keeping information, we re-request it from the source (app or person) from which we obtained it.
