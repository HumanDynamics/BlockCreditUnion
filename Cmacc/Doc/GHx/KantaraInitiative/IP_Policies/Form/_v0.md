1.Ti=ARTICLE 1: OPTIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS POLICIES

1.sec=The Organization shall have a number of different intellectual property policies which can be utilized by a Work Group in governing its operations, including the procedures for providing Draft Technical Specifications for review and which will cover Organization Recommendations produced by that Work Group.

2.Ti=ARTICLE 2: DEFINITIONS

2.0.sec=The definitions in the Bylaws are incorporated by reference.

2.1.sec=“Contribute” means to submit to or for a Work Group proposing an addition to or modification of an existing Technical Specification or a new Technical Specification or portion thereof, provided that the submission is either (i) submitted in writing (including a writing in electronic medium) or (ii) stated orally, memorialized with specificity in the written minutes of a Work Group, and attributed in the meeting minutes to the submitting Participant, provided that the minutes are promptly provided to the individual representing the Participant, unless the submitting Participant withdraws its submission in writing as soon as practicable and in any event, no later than forty-five (45) days of receipt of such written minutes.

2.2.sec="Licensed Materials" shall mean any literary work or other work of authorship, including but not limited to toolkits, software development kits (“SDK”), code, documentation, reference implementations, prototypes, software, software protocols, formats, interfaces and test tools, whether pre-existing or newly created or prepared under the auspices of an Work Group, that is intentionally submitted by one or more Participants for use in the development of or for inclusion in the output of a Work Group.

2.=[Z/ol-none/s2]

3.Ti=ARTICLE 3: CONFIDENTIALITY

3.sec=Licensed Materials that are subject to any requirement of confidentiality may not be considered in any part of the Work Group process. All Licensed Materials will therefore be deemed to have been submitted on a non-confidential basis, notwithstanding any markings or representations to the contrary, and Participants shall have no obligation to treat any such material as confidential.

4.Ti=ARTICLE 4: OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

4.sec=Each Participant shall retain ownership (including, but not limited to, the right to publish or distribute without any obligation of confidentiality) of any of its Licensed Materials that such Participant offers for use in the development of or for inclusion in a Technical Specification or other output of a Work Group, as well as of such Participant’s implementations of the technologies described in a Technical Specification. Where two or more Participants jointly develop Licensed Materials or intellectual property appurtenant thereto (such as copyrights or  patent rights) as part of their work in Kantara Initiative, such Participants shall jointly own any such Licensed Materials and intellectual property, without any obligation of accounting to each other or to the other Participants. To the extent to which a Technical Specification or other Work Group output constitutes a copyrightable work distinct from any Participant's copyright interests in Licensed Materials included as part of such Technical Specification or from which they are derived, the copyright in such Technical Specification or other output of a Work Group shall be owned by the Organization.

5.Ti=ARTICLE 5: TRADEMARKS

5.sec=By a seventy five percent (75%) majority vote of its members, the Board of Trustees may agree to establish one or more trademarks ("Trademark") where the Board concludes that such establishment will serve the goals and objectives of Kantara Initiative including, for example, to indicate compliance of an implementation of an Organization Recommendation Technical Specification; provided, however, that the Board of Trustees shall use reasonable efforts and act in good faith not to establish a Trademark that would be confusingly similar to any trademark or service mark owned by any Trustee. Any Trademark established under this Article 5 shall be owned by a trust or other entity ("Trademark Owner") established by the Board of Trustees on behalf of the Trustees. The Trademark Owner will use commercially reasonable efforts to clear and register the Trademark in those countries designated by the Board of Trustees as necessary countries, with appropriate input from the Trustees. The Trademark Owner will license all Participants to use the Trademark pursuant to terms to be stated in a license agreement in a form approved by the Trademark Owner and Board of Trustees.

6.Ti=ARTICLE 6: NO OTHER LICENSES

6.sec=Except as explicitly set forth, a Participant is not required to grant any other Participant or third party any rights or licenses to any patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights of such Participant.

7.Ti=ARTICLE 7: AMENDMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICIES

7.sec=Except where otherwise provided for in individual Articles herein, this Intellectual Property Policies and the Options may only be altered, amended, or repealed, and new Intellectual Property Policies and Options adopted, upon approval by a Supermajority of the Board.
