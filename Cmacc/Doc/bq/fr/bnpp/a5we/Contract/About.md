Ti=Contracts

sec=This is just a stub.  Contracts would include not just the contracts, but all of the correspondence relating to contracting.  For contracts, as for many of the other categories, the decision of <em>whose</em> "id/Contract" folder to put poses conflicting alternatives.  Of course, search will return all contracts to which the person is a party, even those in the tree of folders of the counterparty.  The solution of picking one of the parties (perhaps the first alphabetically) seems workable, though arbitrary.  This needs more thought.  The issue, of course, goes away if all files are named by their hash and finding is a matter of traversing the graph, or of listings.
