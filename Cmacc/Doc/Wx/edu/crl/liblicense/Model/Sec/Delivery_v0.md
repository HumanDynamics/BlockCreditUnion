Ti=DELIVERY AND ACCESS

1.Ti=Delivery

1.sec=Licensor will provide or otherwise make available the Licensed Materials to the Licensee through telecommunications, network, or web-based connections between one or more of Licensor’s physical, online, or virtual locations, and one or more of Licensee’s authorized physical, online, or virtual locations. Licensor will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Licensed Materials are accessible and inter-operable with prevailing web browsers and internet access tools, including, at a minimum, the most recent two major versions (current version and one version prior) and all the associated releases for those versions.

Note={The LMLA assumes web or other internet-based delivery; if the product involves alternative delivery methods such as locally installed hardware or software or delivery on physical media, this clause would require customization.}

2.Ti=Access and Authentication

2.sec=Licensor will provide the Licensee and its Authorized Users with access to the Licensed Materials pursuant to the terms, conditions, and specifications set forth in Schedule 3, which is attached hereto. Licensor will use reasonable efforts to provide authentication methods that conform to current industry standards, and will cooperate with Licensee in the implementation of new authentication protocols and procedures as they are developed during the term of this Agreement.

Note={Liblicense editors suggest that the above issues be negotiated and addressed in a separate Schedule attached to the main Agreement. Like pricing models, access and authentication specifications vary widely in licensing contracts. The options include the following: 
Note=•	IP addresses (both authenticated and non-authenticated);
Note=•	Proxy servers; 
Note=•	Passwords; 
Note=•	Public keys or certificates;
Note=•	Shibboleth; and
Note=•	Developing protocols not yet developed or tested at the time of Agreement signing. 
Note=These access and authentication specifications may require the expertise of networking professionals, information security specialists, and/or the institution’s chief information officer. For these and other reasons, the LMLA includes a template for Schedule 3, which should be edited to meet your specific needs.}

3.Ti=Restrictions

3.0.sec=Licensor and Licensee agree to the following use and access restrictions on the Licensed Materials.

3.1.Ti=Unauthorized Use

3.1.sec=Except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Agreement, Licensee shall not knowingly or intentionally permit anyone other than Authorized Users to use the Licensed Materials.

3.2.Ti=Modification of Licensed Materials

3.2.sec=Licensee shall not modify or create a derivative work of the Licensed Materials without the Licensor’s express, prior, and written permission, unless the Licensed Materials have been made available under an open license that allows modification and creation of derivative works, are in the public domain, or as provided for elsewhere in this Agreement.

3.3.Ti=Removal of Copyright or Trademark Notice

3.3.sec=Licensee may not remove, obscure or modify any valid copyright or trademark notices included in the Licensed Materials. 

3.4.Ti=Commercial Purposes

3.4.sec=Other than as specifically permitted in this Agreement, Licensee may not use the Licensed Materials for commercial purposes. This restriction expressly prohibits the Licensee from selling Licensed Materials. For the avoidance of doubt, research conducted by Licensee and Authorized Users that is supported by a commercial entity shall not be considered use for commercial purposes.
