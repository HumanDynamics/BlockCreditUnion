Pricing models vary widely and continue to evolve, including fees based on the number of Authorized Users or geographic Sites, periodic subscription fees or one-time purchase fees with or without annual maintenance charges, etc. Additionally, the payment term may be for less than one year, one calendar year, one fiscal year (typically July 1 through June 30) or for multiple years.
