Note={Liblicense editors have provided a more robust dispute resolution clause that includes mediation and arbitration options in an endnote for the LMLA. Since many academic institutions cannot agree to mediation and arbitration, the editors choose to provide these options in the endnote rather than as a part of the main body of the document.}
