Ti=FEES

1.Ti=Fees and Payment

1.sec=Licensee shall pay Licensor for the Licensed Materials pursuant to the terms set forth in Schedule 2, which is attached hereto.

Note={Liblicense editors suggest that these issues be negotiated and addressed in writing in a separate Schedule attached to the main Agreement. Pricing models vary widely and continue to evolve, including fees based on the number of Authorized Users or geographic Sites, periodic subscription fees or one-time purchase fees with or without annual maintenance charges, etc. Additionally, the payment term may be for less than one year, one calendar year, one fiscal year (typically July 1 through June 30) or for multiple years. For these and other reasons, the LMLA includes a template for Schedule 2; this should be edited to meet your specific needs.} 

2.Ti=Notice of Price Increases

2.sec=Licensor shall provide Licensee with a price list for all Licensed Materials no less than {NewPriceList.DaysBeforeEnd.sec}.


NewPriceList.DaysBeforeEnd.Alt1.sec=sixty (60) days prior to the end of the current term

NewPriceList.DaysBeforeEnd.Alt2.sec=no less than sixty (60) days prior to the cancellation notice date

NewPriceList.DaysBeforeEnd.=[Z/Alt/2]

SecName=Fee.2

Note={If negotiating a license specifying a cancellation notice period in Section 6.2, Liblicense editors suggest revising this to read “no less than [sixty (60)] days prior to the cancellation notice date.”}
