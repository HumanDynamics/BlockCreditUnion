Note=This file has "parameterized terms."  We replace terms that we consider to be defined in the Agreement with the same terms, exactly, but wrapped in green.  Note that we have make some judgment calls.  There is unstable use of the defined terms.  We think that "Party" "Party to the Paris Agreement" and "Party to this Agreement" all mean the same thing.  We also consider that the initial cap "Party", as opposed to "party" is used throughout the document even though it should not be - for instance with respect to "Party to the Convention."  These parameterized terms attempt to make that distintion, while not modifying the text at all.  We do that via discretion in the use of green.
