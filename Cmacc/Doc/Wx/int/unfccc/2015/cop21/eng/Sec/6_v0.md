1.sec={Parties} recognize that some {Parties} choose to pursue voluntary cooperation in the implementation of their nationally determined contributions to allow for higher ambition in their mitigation and adaptation actions and to promote sustainable development and environmental integrity.

2.sec={Parties} shall, where engaging on a voluntary basis in cooperative approaches that involve the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes towards nationally determined contributions, promote sustainable development and ensure environmental integrity and transparency, including in governance, and shall apply robust accounting to ensure, inter alia, the avoidance of double counting, consistent with guidance adopted by the {Conference_of_the_Parties} serving as the meeting of the {Parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement}.

3.sec=The use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes to achieve nationally determined contributions under {this_Agreement} shall be voluntary and authorized by participating {Parties}.

It shall be supervised by a body designated by the {Conference_of_the_Parties} serving as the meeting of the {Parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement}, and shall aim:

4.1.sec=To promote the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions while fostering sustainable development;

4.2.sec=To incentivize and facilitate participation in the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions by public and private entities authorized by a {Party};

4.3.sec=To contribute to the reduction of emission levels in the host {Party}, which will benefit from mitigation activities resulting in emission reductions that can also be used by another {Party} to fulfil its nationally determined contribution; and

7.sec=The {Conference_of_the_Parties} serving as the meeting of the {Parties_to_the_Paris_Agreement} shall adopt rules, modalities and procedures for the mechanism referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article at its first session.

8.sec={Parties} recognize the importance of integrated, holistic and balanced non-market approaches being available to {Parties} to assist in the implementation of their nationally determined contributions, in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, in a coordinated and effective manner, including through, inter alia, mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity-building, as appropriate. These approaches shall aim to:

8.1.sec=Promote mitigation and adaptation ambition;

8.2.sec=Enhance public and private sector participation in the implementation of nationally determined contributions; and

8.3.sec=Enable opportunities for coordination across instruments and relevant institutional arrangements.
