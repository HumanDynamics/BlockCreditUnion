5.Ti=No Rights Granted

5.sec=Nothing in this {Agreement} will be construed as granting any rights under any patent, copyright or other intellectual property right of {Discloser}, nor will this {Agreement} grant {Recipient} any rights in or to {Discloser}’s {Confidential Information} other than the limited right to review such {Confidential Information} solely for the purpose of carrying out the Relationship.  Nothing in this {Agreement} requires the disclosure of any {Confidential Information}, which will be disclosed, if at all, solely at {Discloser}’s option.

8.sec=In the event that {Recipient} or any person to whom they or their representatives transmit or have transmitted {Confidential Information} become legally compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas, civil investigative demands or otherwise) to disclose any {Confidential Information}, the {Recipient} will provide the {Discloser} with prompt written notice so that the {Discloser} may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, or both, or waive compliance with the provisions of this {Agreement}.  In the event that the {Discloser} is unable to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy, or if it so directs the {Recipient}, the {Recipient} will furnish only that portion of the {Confidential Information} that the {Recipient} is advised by written opinion of its counsel is legally required to be furnished by it and will exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such {Confidential Information}.

Due to the unique nature of {Discloser}’s {Confidential Information}, monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate {Discloser} for any breach by {Recipient} of its covenants and {Agreement}s set forth in this {Agreement}.  Accordingly, the parties each agree and acknowledge that any violation or threatened violation may cause irreparable injury to {Discloser}.
