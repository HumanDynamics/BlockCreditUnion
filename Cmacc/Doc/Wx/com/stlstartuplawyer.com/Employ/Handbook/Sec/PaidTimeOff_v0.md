Ti=Paid Time Off

0.sec=Paid Time Off (PTO) provides you with the flexibility to use your time off to meet your personal needs, while recognizing your individual responsibility to manage your paid time off. You will accumulate a specified amount of PTO each pay period worked and it is up to you to allocate how you will use it – for vacation, illness, caring for children, school activities, medical/dental appointments, leave, personal business or emergencies.  The Company may require you to use any unpaid PTO during disability or family medical leave, or any other leave of absence.  The amount of PTO earned will depend on your length of service with the Company. Other Company policies may provide employees paid time off that is in addition to the PTO provided in this policy.

2.Ti=Deposits Into Your PTO Account

4.Ti=Maximum Time Accumulated

4.Alt1.sec=You may not accumulate PTO from year to year.  Any PTO not used at the end of your PTO  year is forfeited.

=OR

4.Alt2.sec={You may carry over unused PTO from year to year; however, there is a cap on the amount of PTO time you may accumulate. This encourages you to use your PTO and allows the Company to manage its financial obligations responsibly.  Once you reach your cap, you will not accumulate any more PTO until you use some of the time in your account and drop below the cap.  After your balance goes below the cap, you will begin accruing PTO again.  However, you will not receive retroactive credit for time worked while you were at the cap limit. PTO accrual is capped at your Maximum Annual Accrual plus {40} hours.}

=OR

4.Alt3.sec={You may carry over unused PTO from year to year and will be paid any accrued but unused balance upon separation from employment.  There is no maximum carryover.}

6.Ti=Management of PTO

6.sec=You are responsible for managing your PTO account.  It is important that you plan ahead for how you will use it.  This means developing a plan for taking your vacations, as well as doctor’s appointments and personal business.  It also means holding some time in “reserve” for the unexpected, such as emergencies and illnesses.
7.Ti=Minimum Increments of PTO

7.sec=The minimum amount of PTO you can use at one time depends on whether you are an hourly or salaried employee.  If you are an hourly employee, you may not take less than {one} hour off at a time.  If you are a salaried employee you must take PTO in increments of not less than {one-half day}.

8.Ti=Notice, Scheduling and Approval

8.1.sec=You are required to provide your supervisor with reasonable advance notice and obtain approval prior to using PTO.  This allows for you and your supervisor to prepare for your time off and assure that all staffing needs are met. There may be occasions, such as illness, when you cannot notify your supervisor in advance. In those situations, you must inform your supervisor of your circumstances as soon as possible.

8.2.sec=In order to ensure continuity of business operations, supervisors may limit the number of employees to which they grant approved time off at any one time.  If more than one employee requests the same period of time off, approval is granted by {employee seniority {if the time period is over three months away}.  Approval is granted by the order the request is received if the filing periods is less than three months away}. While you are encouraged to use your PTO, requests for PTO may not exceed {10} consecutive business days.

9.Ti=Compulsory Use of PTO

9.sec=Some circumstances will mandate that you use PTO. You may not take any unpaid time off if you have accrued PTO.  Regardless of reason for absence, if you have PTO available, you must use it for the time you are not at work, unless specifically addressed elsewhere in this policy, or by another company policy. If you appear sick, you may be asked to go home and use your PTO for the time you are away. This is to protect the work force by preventing the spread of sickness to other employees.
10.Ti=Required Documentation for Select Circumstances

10.sec=Time off must be scheduled in advance whenever possible.  Unfortunately, opportunities exist for employees to try to extend planned and approved time off by calling in sick before or after holidays, vacations, etc., as well as by calling in sick multiple days in a row. In the exceptional circumstances that you may need to take PTO for sickness either immediately prior to or immediately following approved time off or holidays, you will be required to provide some form of documentation from a health care provider indicating you were treated for illness. Additionally, if you must take more than three unplanned days off for illness, you will be required to provide some form of documentation from a health care provider indicating you were treated for illness.

11.Ti=Recording Paid Time Off

11.sec=You must complete an Absence Report for all PTO time used.  We are required to track absences for illness, work related illness/injury, or the attendance of school related activities for legal compliance reasons. The amount of PTO accrued, used and available will appear on your paycheck stub.
