These terms may be used individually, or in combination with each other. If you have any questions about the meaning of any of these, your {supervisor/other title} will answer these questions for you.

={Include Applicable Categories}

7.1.sec=Full-time Regular Employees -- Employees hired to work a workweek of {forty (40)} hours or more on a regular basis. Your position may require a regular schedule of more than {40} hours a week. Full-time regular employees may be "exempt" or "nonexempt" as defined below. These employees will be eligible for benefits (such as {medical, dental, vision, life insurance}, etc.) as well as Paid Time Off and Holiday pay.

={Note:  Less than 40 hours may be established as full-time.  Under the Affordable Care Act, 30 hours will be considered full-time; however, that provision has not been implemented at this time.  Eligibility for insurance benefits is determined by the individual benefit plans, which must be consulted in drafting the handbook benefit eligibility requirements.}

7.2.1.sec=Reduced Regular Employees – Hourly employees hired to work a normal, reduced workweek of {thirty (30) to thirty-nine (39)} hours on a regular basis. Your position may occasionally require more than {39} hours a week.

Eligibility for insurance benefits is determined by the individual benefit plans, which must be consulted in drafting the handbook benefit eligibility requirements.

7.3.sec=Part-time Regular Employees – Employees hired to work fewer than {thirty (30)} hours per week on a regular basis. Such employees may be "exempt" or "nonexempt" as defined below.

Introductory employees are evaluated at or near the end of their first 90 days of service, at which time a decision will be made to continue their service as a regular employee, to extend their introductory period, or to terminate their employment. Successful completion of the introductory period does not guarantee continued employment and does not alter an employee’s at-will employment status.

7.5.sec=Temporary Employees – Employees engaged to work full time or part time with the understanding that their employment will typically be terminated upon completion of a specific project or assignment. Temporary employees will not be eligible for benefits (such as medical, dental, vision, life insurance, etc.) and will not be eligible for Paid Time Off or Holiday pay. A temporary employee may be offered and may accept a new temporary assignment, including consecutive temporary assignments, and still retain temporary status. Temporary employees may be "exempt" or "nonexempt" as defined below. Individuals contracted from temporary employment agencies for specific assignments are considered employees of the respective agency and are not considered employees of {Company Name}. Temporary agency employees are paid by the respective agency and are not Company employees and are not eligible for Company benefits.}
