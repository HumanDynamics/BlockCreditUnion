=PART ONE

=GENERAL EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION

=Equal Employment Opportunity

=This company is an equal opportunity employer and does not unlawfully discriminate against employees or applicants for employment on the basis of an individual’s race, color, religion, creed, sex, [optional: sexual orientation], national origin, age, disability, marital status, veteran status or any other status protected by applicable law. This policy applies to all terms, conditions and privileges of employment, including recruitment, hiring, placement, compensation, promotion, discipline and termination.

=[Note: Sexual orientation is a protected characteristic in some states, cities and municipalities; it may be included as a separate item if preferred; otherwise it is included within “other characteristics as provided by law, where applicable.]

=The company makes reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities as required by law. Employees who would like to request a reasonable accommodation should contact [name/position/title].

=At-Will Employment

=Your employment with Cool Touch is at-will unless you have a written employment agreement with Cool Touch which provides otherwise. Nothing in this handbook creates or is intended to create a promise or representation of continued employment. This handbook supersedes any and all prior handbooks, written documents (with the exception of written employment agreements) or oral or implied representations that might otherwise contradict the at-will nature of your employment.

=[Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)]

=(Include if Company has 15 or more employees)

=The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, unless it would cause undue hardship to [Company Name]. A reasonable accommodation may include changes in the work environment or in the way a job is performed that enables a person with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities. If you require an accommodation, you must inform your Supervisor that there is a need for an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a disability. We will respond promptly and to the best of our ability to accommodate the needs of all employees with disabilities.

=Immigration Law Compliance

=We are required by law to verify the eligible employment status of all new employees. To comply we must determine that any new employee meets the terms of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.  As a condition of employment all new hires or rehired employees must properly complete, sign and date the first section of the Immigration and Naturalization Service Form I-9.  The form must be completed and on file before you are allowed to start work.  [Optional:  Add E-Verify provision for companies required to participate in the E-Verify Program  (i.e. government contractors with contracts >$5,000)]

=Employment Applications

=[Company Name] relies upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment application, as well as the accuracy of resumes or other data presented throughout the hiring process and employment. Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this information or data may result in the exclusion from further consideration for employment.  Employees who have falsified information on their employment applications may be subject to discipline, which could include termination.

=[Background/Reference Checks]

=(Include if Company is required to conduct background checks by law or if the Company has certain high risk positions (handling money, handling sensitive information) and prefers to conduct background checks on some or all employees.)

=[Note: Some states have restrictions on background checks and the Company should seek guidance for each state in which it has employees before conducting background checks.]

=[Company Name] may conduct reference and background checks on [all/certain] new [and current] employees [depending upon their position with the Company]. Employees who are required to submit to such background checks, including criminal and credit history reports, must sign consent forms as required by the Company.

=Definition of Employment Status

=When you read this Employee Handbook, you will see terms like “regular full time employee.” In order to help you understand what is meant by these terms, we have provided the following definitions. These terms may be used individually, or in combination with each other. If you have any questions about the meaning of any of these, your [supervisor/other title] will answer these questions for you.

=[Include Applicable Categories]

=•	Full-time Regular Employees -- Employees hired to work a workweek of [forty (40)] hours or more on a regular basis. Your position may require a regular schedule of more than [40] hours a week. Full-time regular employees may be "exempt" or "nonexempt" as defined below. These employees will be eligible for benefits (such as [medical, dental, vision, life insurance], etc.) as well as Paid Time Off and Holiday pay.

=[Note:  Less than 40 hours may be established as full-time.  Under the Affordable Care Act, 30 hours will be considered full-time; however, that provision has not been implemented at this time.  Eligibility for insurance benefits is determined by the individual benefit plans, which must be consulted in drafting the handbook benefit eligibility requirements.]

=•	Reduced Regular Employees – Hourly employees hired to work a normal, reduced workweek of [thirty (30) to thirty-nine (39)] hours on a regular basis. Your position may occasionally require more than [39] hours a week. [Add, if applicable: These employees will be eligible for benefits (such as medical, dental, vision, life insurance, etc.) as well as Paid Time Off and Holiday pay.]  Reduced Regular Employee status is only available to nonexempt employees.

=[Note:  This is an optional category.  The range of hours may be changed.  If this category is used, different hourly requirements can be set.  Eligibility for insurance benefits is determined by the individual benefit plans, which must be consulted in drafting the handbook benefit eligibility requirements.]

=•	Part-time Regular Employees – Employees hired to work fewer than [thirty (30)] hours per week on a regular basis. Such employees may be "exempt" or "nonexempt" as defined below. These employees [will/will not] be eligible for benefits (such as medical, dental, vision, life insurance, etc.) and [will/will not] be eligible for Paid Time Off or Holiday pay.]

=[Note: This is an optional category.  If this category is used, different hourly requirements can be set.  Eligibility for insurance benefits is determined by the individual benefit plans, which must be consulted in drafting the handbook benefit eligibility requirements.]

=•	Introductory Employees – Introductory employees are those with fewer than 90 days of service or who have worked 90 days but who have had their introductory status extended. Introductory employees [are/are not] eligible for [some] Company benefits.  Introductory employees are evaluated at or near the end of their first 90 days of service, at which time a decision will be made to continue their service as a regular employee, to extend their introductory period, or to terminate their employment. Successful completion of the introductory period does not guarantee continued employment and does not alter an employee’s at-will employment status.

=•	Temporary Employees – Employees engaged to work full time or part time with the understanding that their employment will typically be terminated upon completion of a specific project or assignment. Temporary employees will not be eligible for benefits (such as medical, dental, vision, life insurance, etc.) and will not be eligible for Paid Time Off or Holiday pay. A temporary employee may be offered and may accept a new temporary assignment, including consecutive temporary assignments, and still retain temporary status. Temporary employees may be "exempt" or "nonexempt" as defined below. Individuals contracted from temporary employment agencies for specific assignments are considered employees of the respective agency and are not considered employees of [Company Name]. Temporary agency employees are paid by the respective agency and are not Company employees and are not eligible for Company benefits.]

=[Note:  Temporary employees have been held to be “joint employees” of the staffing companies placing them and companies where they are placed in some jurisdictions.  Consult with your attorney for specific requirements if you engage temporary employees.]

=Each regular and temporary employee will further be classified as either exempt or non-exempt.

=•	Nonexempt Employees − Employees who are required to be paid at least minimum wage and overtime at the federal, state or local prescribed wage rate, whichever is higher. Nonexempt employees may be paid hourly or salary and are required to complete and provide accurate records of their hours worked.

=

=•	Exempt Employees – Employees who are not eligible for overtime and in some cases also not subject to minimum wage regulations, in accordance with applicable federal, state and local wage and hour laws.  Exempt employees are paid a salary and are expected to work a sufficient number of hours to complete their assigned work duties and responsibilities to meet the goals and client service standards of the Company.

=[New Employee Introductory Period]

=The first ninety (90) calendar days of your employment are considered introductory. This period is designed to provide you with an opportunity to become acquainted with your job and with the Company.

=In your first days of employment, you will be provided with an overview of your job responsibilities and the Company’s policies, procedures and benefits. Your supervisor will spend time with you to ensure that you are aware of your job responsibilities during the first weeks of employment.  During the 90 day period, your supervisor will conduct an evaluation of your progress.  The purpose of this evaluation is to provide you and your supervisor with an opportunity to discuss your progress to assure that you understand your job responsibilities.  After 90 days, or at any time within the introductory period at the Company’s discretion, you will either be reclassified to regular employee status or your employment with the Company will end.  In special circumstances, an extension of the introductory period may be warranted.

=Personnel Records

=You are responsible for ensuring that all information regarding your name, address, telephone number(s), withholding instructions, dependents, insurance beneficiaries and emergency contacts, is up to date.  Employees must promptly notify [position/title] of any changes of information. Failure to do so could result in the loss of benefits or missed emergency notifications.

=Employment References

=All employment verification or reference requests on current or former employees are to be referred to [position/title]. [Company Name] personnel are not authorized to respond to reference requests or provide references on current or former employees without express permission from [position/title].  [Company Name] normally releases only last title and dates of employment.

=Requests for employment verification for credit or mortgage purposes should be referred to [position/title]. Certain information will be provided only if the employee has signed a release.

=[Employment of Relatives]

=It is the policy of the Company not to employ members of an employee’s immediate family as regular employees.  For the purposes of this policy, the immediate family is defined to include the employee’s spouse, parents, parents-in-law, step-parents, siblings, step-siblings, siblings-in-law, or children.

=[Alternate:  Employment of Relatives]

=[Company Name] allows the employment of relatives; however, to avoid issues of favoritism or conflicts employees may not have a direct or indirect reporting relationship or be in a position regarding hiring, work assignments, discipline, compensation or evaluations, with a spouse, partner, blood relative or relative by marriage.

=In the event you become a spouse, partner, or relative by marriage with another employee after you begin employment, you must disclose this relationship to your supervisor.  The company reserves the right to take action to avoid actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest or issues of favoritism from such relationships, which may include a transfer or reassignment, or if transfer or reassignment is not possible, separation from employment for either or both employees.

=Hours of Work

=Your supervisor will establish your specific hours of work.  Your hours will be based on the Company’s need to provide our customers with the most convenient and efficient service possible.  From time to time your supervisor may ask you to deviate from your normal hours of work, which may include overtime.  You are expected to be at work during your scheduled hours  and any requested overtime, unless prior arrangements have been made through [your supervisor/other title].

=[Alternate:  Hours of Work]

=Regular work hours are [8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.], with a one-hour lunch break [Optional: and [2] [10] minute breaks per day]. All non-exempt employees are expected to take their scheduled meal break. Shortening or eliminating the lunch break in order to shorten the workday or to cause overtime is not allowed on a regular basis, and must be approved by [your supervisor/other title] in advance. You are expected to be at work during your scheduled hours unless prior arrangements have been made through [your supervisor/other title]. All employees will notify their Supervisor of any exceptions to their normal work schedule. From time to time, you may be asked to deviate from your normal hours of work, which may include overtime. You are expected to comply with such requests, unless you are exempted under other provisions of this handbook.

=[Flexible Work Arrangements]

=Standard work schedules for nonexempt employees occur within [Company Name]’s normal hours of operation.  [Company Name] gives employees the opportunity to request defined non-standard work schedules to meet their individual needs. These schedules are referred to as Alternate Work Arrangements.

=[Supervisors/other title] on a case-by-case basis will consider Alternate Work Arrangements, subject to approval by [Title]. If it is determined by the [supervisor/other title] that an Alternate Work Arrangement might be feasible, the employee must complete an Alternate Work Arrangement Agreement. If approved by the [supervisor/other title] and [Title], the signed document will be retained in the employee’s personnel file. Alternate work arrangements may not be feasible within some departments or for certain positions within a department and application for such arrangement is not a guarantee that it will be granted.

=If an Alternate Work Arrangement is granted, [Company Name] has the right to cancel, suspend, or modify an employee's Alternate Work Arrangement privilege at any time, for any reason. An Alternate Work Arrangement is not a contract of employment and employment under any such arrangement remains at-will.  Daily and weekly work schedules, including Alternate Work Arrangements, can be modified at the Company’s discretion to meet changing business conditions, including but not limited to the Company’s need for employees to work overtime.

=Performance/Salary Reviews

=[We believe in the merit pay philosophy. This philosophy is based on the premise that employees should be rewarded based on their efforts.] You will generally have one performance/salary review per year.  Additional salary reviews may be authorized for employees in case of promotion, transfer, or other changes in employment status. Annual pay increases are not guaranteed, however, and are subject to Company performance, among other factors.

=Promotions [Optional: and Transfers]

=It is the policy of the Company to promote from within wherever applicable.  Interested internal candidates for an opening should make their interest known in writing to their supervisor for the open position.  [Optional: Transfers within the Company are also possible.  As with promotions, interested internal candidates for an opening should make their interest known in writing to the [Title] for the open position.] To be eligible for promotion [or transfer], in addition to meeting the requirements for the new position, employees must be performing at a satisfactory level in their current position.  Employees who have received poor performance reviews or who have been disciplined may not be eligible for promotion.  In order to insure that all positions are filled in a timely manner and with the best person for the job, the Company reserves the right to solicit outside applicants for any position.

=[Outside Employment]

=Non-exempt employees may work for other organizations or companies upon prior written approval of [Title], provided that the duties of the secondary employment do not interfere with job performance at the Company, including the ability to work overtime as requested by the Company, do not constitute a conflict of interest, nor are in competition with [Company Name]’s business.  You are required to submit an Outside Employment Request Form prior to accepting other employment and approval of outside employment must be documented in your employee file.

=All employees will be judged by the same performance standards and will be subject to scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements. If it is determined that an employee’s outside work interferes with performance, safety or the ability to meet the requirements of [Company Name] as they are modified from time to time, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside employment if he/she desires to remain with [Company Name].  Outside employment that constitutes a conflict of interest is prohibited. Employees also may not receive any income or material gain from individuals outside [Company Name] for materials produced or services rendered while performing their jobs with [Company Name] [optional: and you agree to sign the Company’s Confidentiality and Assigment of Intellectual Property Agreement.]

=Separation from Employment

=While we hope that your association with the Company will be a long and enjoyable one, we realize that employees sometimes decide to separate from employment with the Company for personal or professional reasons.  If you decide to resign, you should notify your supervisor in writing at least two weeks prior to your anticipated last day of work.  If your employment is terminated before completion of the year, you [will/will not] be paid for accrued but unused Paid Time Off (“PTO”), as set out below. [If paid:  This accrued, but unused balance will be paid upon resignation only if a minimum of a two weeks’ notice is provided and you work as scheduled during the entire two week notice period.  If two weeks’ notice is not provided, the balance of PTO owed will be forfeited.

=[Note:  Some states require payment of accrued vacation and/or leave time, which cannot be forfeited.  The Company should seek guidance for each state in which it has has employees in determining whether accrued benefits must be paid upon termination of employment.]

=[Optional:  Management may conduct an exit interview to discuss your reasons for leaving and any other impressions that you may have about the Company. During the exit interview, you can provide insights into areas for improvement for [Company Name] and your specific position.]

=The Company does not provide letters of recommendation for former employees. We will confirm position/title and dates of employment in response to inquiries from outside parties.  All reference requests must be directed to the President of the Company and no other Company employee is authorized to provide a response to any inquiries about a former employee’s employment.

=Return of Company Property

=Any property issued to you by [Company Name], such as software, computer equipment, databases, files, cell phones, chargers, keys, parking passes or credit card(s) must be returned at the time of your termination. You will be responsible for any lost or damaged items. The Company may take action to recoup any replacement costs, and/or seek the return of Company property through appropriate legal recourse.  In the event you fail to return Company property, the Company may deduct the value of any Company property that is not returned from your final paycheck.

=Non-Exempt Employees – If your position is classified as non-exempt, you will be paid time-and-one half for all hours worked over 40 hours in a single work week, unless otherwise required by law. Overtime pay is based on actual hours worked. Time taken for meals and breaks is not included as time worked for purposes of computing overtime. All time taken for lunch, breaks or leaving Company property for personal reasons must be recorded on your time records.  Time off on holidays, vacation leave, personal leave, or any leave of absence will not be included in calculating overtime.

=Unless specifically directed to work overtime hours, non-exempt employees should begin and end work and take meal breaks at the designated times.

=[Regular full-time employees, Reduced Regular and Part Time] employees who have completed their 90-day introductory period will be paid for the above holidays if, on the days before and after the holiday, they work as scheduled, are on approved PTO leave, or are absent but have a doctor’s note verifying the illness. [Temporary and Introductory] employees are not eligible for holiday pay. Holidays which occur during an employee’s PTO period will be considered holidays and will not be charged as PTO time.  Holiday pay will not be counted as time worked for the purposes of computing overtime.

=[Due to the nature of the Company’s business it will occasionally be necessary for employees to work on designated holidays.  Staffing on holidays will generally be determined on a voluntary basis and, if required, on the basis of seniority.  Non-exempt employees who work on company holidays will be paid for the holiday [at their usual rate, unless the work results in overtime] [at one and a half times their usual rate, regardless of whether the work results in overtime].

You may use PTO or unpaid leave for your absence.

=Paid Time Off

=Insert Company PTO or vacation/sick leave policy.

=[Alternate:  Paid Time Off]

=Paid Time Off (PTO) provides you with the flexibility to use your time off to meet your personal needs, while recognizing your individual responsibility to manage your paid time off. You will accumulate a specified amount of PTO each pay period worked and it is up to you to allocate how you will use it – for vacation, illness, caring for children, school activities, medical/dental appointments, leave, personal business or emergencies.  The Company may require you to use any unpaid PTO during disability or family medical leave, or any other leave of absence.

=Eligibility

=You are eligible to receive PTO if you are a [regular full-time, part-time or introductory] status employee scheduled to work at least [40] hours per week.

=Accrual Schedule for Full Time Employees

=	Years of Service		Hours Accrued			Maximum Annual

=										Accrual (Hours)

=		[0 – 4]			[5.00] hours/pay period			[120]

=		[5 – 14]		[6.67] hours/pay period			[160]

=		[15 +]			[8.34] hours/pay period			[200]

=Maximum Time Accumulated

=[You may not accumulate PTO from year to year.  Any PTO not used at the end of your PTO  year is forfeited.]

=OR

=[You may carry over unused PTO from year to year; however, there is a cap on the amount of PTO time you may accumulate. This encourages you to use your PTO and allows the Company to manage its financial obligations responsibly.  Once you reach your cap, you will not accumulate any more PTO until you use some of the time in your account and drop below the cap.  After your balance goes below the cap, you will begin accruing PTO again.  However, you will not receive retroactive credit for time worked while you were at the cap limit. PTO accrual is capped at your Maximum Annual Accrual plus [40] hours.]

=OR

=[You may carry over unused PTO from year to year and will be paid any accrued but unused balance upon separation from employment.  There is no maximum carryover.]

=Termination

=[You will be paid for all accrued but unused PTO when you leave the Company, unless terminated for cause.]

=OR

=[All unused PTO is forfeited upon termination of employment for any reason and you will not be paid for any unused PTO at the time your employment ends.]

=[Note: Some states do not permit forfeiture of PTO upon termination for cause.

=Management of PTO

=You are responsible for managing your PTO account.  It is important that you plan ahead for how you will use it.  This means developing a plan for taking your vacations, as well as doctor’s appointments and personal business.  It also means holding some time in “reserve” for the unexpected, such as emergencies and illnesses.

=Minimum Increments of PTO

=The minimum amount of PTO you can use at one time depends on whether you are an hourly or salaried employee.  If you are an hourly employee, you may not take less than [one] hour off at a time.  If you are a salaried employee you must take PTO in increments of not less than [one-half day].

=Notice, Scheduling and Approval

=You are required to provide your supervisor with reasonable advance notice and obtain approval prior to using PTO.  This allows for you and your supervisor to prepare for your time off and assure that all staffing needs are met. There may be occasions, such as illness, when you cannot notify your supervisor in advance. In those situations, you must inform your supervisor of your circumstances as soon as possible.

=In order to ensure continuity of business operations, supervisors may limit the number of employees to which they grant approved time off at any one time.  If more than one employee requests the same period of time off, approval is granted by [employee seniority [if the time period is over three months away].  Approval is granted by the order the request is received if the filing periods is less than three months away]. While you are encouraged to use your PTO, requests for PTO may not exceed [10] consecutive business days.

=Compulsory Use of PTO

=Some circumstances will mandate that you use PTO. You may not take any unpaid time off if you have accrued PTO.  Regardless of reason for absence, if you have PTO available, you must use it for the time you are not at work, unless specifically addressed elsewhere in this policy, or by another company policy. If you appear sick, you may be asked to go home and use your PTO for the time you are away. This is to protect the work force by preventing the spread of sickness to other employees.

=Required Documentation for Select Circumstances

=Time off must be scheduled in advance whenever possible.  Unfortunately, opportunities exist for employees to try to extend planned and approved time off by calling in sick before or after holidays, vacations, etc., as well as by calling in sick multiple days in a row. In the exceptional circumstances that you may need to take PTO for sickness either immediately prior to or immediately following approved time off or holidays, you will be required to provide some form of documentation from a health care provider indicating you were treated for illness. Additionally, if you must take more than three unplanned days off for illness, you will be required to provide some form of documentation from a health care provider indicating you were treated for illness.

=Recording Paid Time Off
