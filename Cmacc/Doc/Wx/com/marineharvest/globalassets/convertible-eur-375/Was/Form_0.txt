Conversion Right Unless previously redeemed, according to the terms herein, or purchased and cancelled, each bondholder (a “Bondholder”) may exercise one or more of his conversion right(s) at the Conversion Price on or after the 41st Banking Day following the Closing Date at any time until the fifteenth (15) Banking Day prior to the Maturity Date, or, if earlier, ending on the fifteenth (15) Banking Day prior to the date for redemption of the Bonds (the “Exercise Period”).

Bondholders will be entitled to convert Bonds into Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number) at the Conversion Price at any time during the Exercise Period.

In the case of an exercise of the Conversion Right in respect of a Bond, interest shall cease to accrue on such Bond with effect from the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding the relevant Conversion Date

Issuer Call The Issuer may, on or after 6 June 2017, with a twenty (20) Banking Days notice period, call the remaining part of the Loan in cash at its par value plus accrued interest, provided that the Parity Value on each of at least twenty (20) dealing days within a period of thirty (30) consecutive dealing days ending not earlier than the dealing day prior to the date of the redemption notice, have exceeded EUR 130,000. Each Bondholder may, within the Exercise Period, elect to exercise its Conversion Right after having received the Issuer’s call option notice.

“Parity Value” means, in respect of any dealing day, the EUR amount calculated as follows:

ܸܲ ൌ ܰ ൈ ܸܹܣܲ

where:

PV = the Parity Value.

N = the number of Shares determined by dividing EUR 100,000 by the Conversion Price in effect on such dealing day (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole Share).

VWAP = the Volume Weighted Average Price of a Share on such dealing day (provided that if on any such dealing day the Shares shall have been quoted cumDividend or cum-any other entitlement, the closing price on such dealing day shall be deemed to be the amount thereof reduced by an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of any such Dividend or entitlement per Share as at the date of first public announcement of such Dividend or entitlement (or, if that is not a dealing day, the immediately preceding dealing day)), translated into EUR at the Prevailing Rate on such dealing day.

Investor Put None (except in case of Change of Control).

Share Settlement Option The Issuer may redeem the Bonds on the Maturity Date by exercising a Share Settlement Option with respect to all of the Bonds, provided that the Shares are listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and no Event of Default has occurred, by giving notice to the Loan Trustee and the Bondholder not more than 60 nor less than 30 calendar days prior to the Maturity Date.

The Issuer shall exercise the Share Settlement Option by:

a) issuing or transferring and delivering to the relevant Bondholder such number of Shares as is determined by dividing the aggregate principal amount of such Bondholder’s Bonds by the Conversion Price in effect on the Valuation Date;

b) making payment to the relevant Bondholder of an amount (the “Cash Settlement Amount”) equal to the amount (if any) by which the principal aggregate amount of such Bonds exceeds the product of the Current Value of a Share on the Valuation Date and the whole number of Shares deliverable to such Bondholder in accordance with (a) above; and

c) making or procuring payment to the relevant Bondholder in cash of any accrued and unpaid interest in respect of such Bonds up to the Maturity Date.

“Valuation Date” means the date falling three dealing days prior to the Maturity Date.

“Current Value” in respect of a Share on the Valuation Date shall mean 99% of the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Share for the twenty consecutive dealing days ending on the Valuation Date, translated into EUR at the spot rate of exchange prevailing at the close of business on each such dealing day. 

Cash Settlement Option The obligation of the Issuer to issue Shares on the exercise of any Bondholder’s Conversion Rights may, at the sole discretion of the Issuer, be settled, in whole or in part, by cash payment. The cash settlement payment shall be the product of (i) the number of Shares otherwise deliverable under such Bondholder's Bonds and in respect of which the Issuer has elected such cash settlement option and (ii) the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price for the twenty consecutive dealing days immediately after the date the Issuer elects to exercise its cash settlement option in respect of the relevant Bonds.

Clean-up Call In the event that Conversion Rights shall have been exercised and/or purchases (and corresponding cancellations) and/or redemptions effected in respect of 85 per cent or more in principal amount of the Bonds originally issued.

Anti-dilution Protection Standard Euromarket anti-dilution provisions through adjustment of the Conversion Price.

Change of Control Protection

A “Change of Control Event” shall occur where a shareholder or a group of shareholders of the Issuer acting in concert, directly or indirectly (including purchase, merger etc.) have acquired the right to cast, at a general meeting of shareholders of the Issuer, more than 50 per cent of the voting rights of the Issuer.

If a Change of Control Event has occurred, each Bondholder shall at any time during the period commencing on the date on which such Change of Control Event occurred and ending sixty (60) calendar days following such date or, if later, sixty (60) calendar days period following the notification of such Change of Control Event, be entitled at its option to (at each Bondholder’s discretion) either:

(i) require early redemption of its Bonds (put option) at 100% of par value plus accrued interest;

or

(ii) convert its Bonds at the Change of Control Conversion Price, as set out below (adjusted to reflect any previous Adjustment to the Conversion Price (if applicable)): ܥܱܥܥ ܲ ൌ ሾܴܲ ൈ ሺܰ െ ݊ሻሿ ൅ ሾሺܱܥܲ ൈ ݊ሻሿ ܰ where:

(a) cease to carry on its business;

(b) sell or dispose of all or a substantial part of its assets or operations;

(c) change the nature of its business;

 (d) merge, demerge or in any other way restructure its business; in a manner which (in the reasonable opinion of the Loan Trustee) is likely to be materially adverse to (i) the ability of the Issuer to perform any of its obligations under the Loan Agreement and/or (ii) the business, assets or financial condition of the Group as a whole.
