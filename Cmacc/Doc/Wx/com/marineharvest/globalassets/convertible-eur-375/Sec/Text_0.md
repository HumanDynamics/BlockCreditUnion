1.7.sec=An investment in the {Bonds} involves a significant degree of risk. In making any decision to purchase the {Bonds}, an investor will be deemed to (a) have such business and financial experience as is required to give it the capacity to protect its own interests in connection with the purchase of the {Bonds}, (b) not rely on any investigation that the {Managers} or any of their affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the {Managers} or any of their affiliates, may have conducted with respect to the {Issuer} or the {Securities}, (c) have made its own investment decision regarding the {Bonds} based on its own knowledge and investigation of the {Issuer}, the terms of the {Bonds} and the {Securities}, (d) rely on its own examination of the {Issuer}, its subsidiaries, the {Securities} and the terms of the placement of the {Bonds}, including the merits and risks involved, (e) make its own assessment of the {Issuer}, its subsidiaries, the {Bonds} and the terms of the placement of the {Bonds} based on this term sheet and such other information as is publicly available and as it deems reasonably sufficient (which such investor is deemed to have been able to access, read and understand), and (f) consult its own independent advisers or otherwise satisfy itself concerning, without limitation, accounting, regulatory, tax or other consequences in the light of its particular situation under the laws of all relevant jurisdictions generally.

The {Managers} do not intend to disclose the extent of any such investment or transactions otherwise than in accordance with any legal or regulatory obligation to do so.

Neither the {Issuer} nor the {Managers} makes any representation as to (i) the suitability of the {Securities} for any particular investor, (ii) the appropriate accounting treatment and potential tax consequences of investing in the {Securities} or (iii) the future performance of the {Securities} either in absolute terms or relative to competing investments (including, without limitation, the {Issuer}’s ability to repay or refinance the {Securities} at any relevant time).

1.9.sec=In connection with the offering, the {Managers} or their subsidiaries and affiliates may, for their own account, enter into asset swaps, credit derivatives or other derivative transactions relating to the {Securities} and/or the underlying shares at the same time as the offer and sale of the {Securities} or in secondary market transactions. The {Managers} or any of their affiliates may from time to time hold long or short positions in or buy and sell such {Securities} or derivatives or the underlying shares.

1.11.sec=Any allocation of the {Securities} is made expressly subject to the terms and disclosure set out in the loan agreement, and on the condition that any offering of the {Securities} completes and that the {Securities} are issued. In particular, it should be noted that any such offering and formal documentation relating thereto will be subject to conditions precedent and termination events, including those which are customary for such an offering. Any such offering will not complete unless such conditions precedent are fulfilled and any such termination events have not taken place or the failure to fulfil such a condition precedent or the occurrence of a termination event has been waived, if applicable. The {Managers} reserves the right to exercise or refrain from exercising their rights in relation to the fulfilment or otherwise of any such condition precedent or the occurrence of any termination event in such manner as they may determine in their absolute discretion.

1.12.sec=No action has been taken by the {Issuer}, the {Managers} or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates that would permit an offering of the {Securities} or possession or distribution of this document or any offering or publicity material relating to such {Securities} in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. Persons into whose possession this document comes are required by the {Issuer} and the {Managers} to inform themselves about and to observe any such restrictions.

2.Ti=EEA Selling Restriction and Deemed Investor Representations

2.1.sec=This document and the offer (when made) are only addressed to and directed at residents of member states of the European Economic Area which have implemented the prospectus directive (each, a “{Relevant_Member_State}”), at persons who are “{Qualified_Investors}” within the meaning of Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Directive (Directive 2003/71/EC) and pursuant to the relevant implementing rules and regulations adopted by each {Relevant_Member_State} (“{Qualified_Investors}”). 

2.2.sec=Each person who initially acquires any {Securities} or to whom any offer of {Securities} may be made will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a {Qualified_Investor}. This document is a financial promotion. In the United Kingdom, this document is being distributed only to, and is directed only at, {Qualified_Investors} (i) who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (financial promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “{Order}”) or (ii) who fall within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the {Order}, and (iii) to whom it may otherwise lawfully be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “{Relevant_Persons}”). This document must not be acted on or relied on (i) in the United Kingdom, by persons who are not {Relevant_Persons}, and (ii) in any member state of the European Economic Area other than the United Kingdom, by persons who are not {Qualified_Investors}.

2.3.sec=In the case of any {Securities} being offered to you as a financial intermediary (as that term is used in Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive), you will also be deemed to have represented and agreed that the {Securities} acquired by you in the offering have not been acquired on behalf of persons in the EEA other than {Qualified_Investors} for whom you have authority to make decisions on a wholly discretionary basis, nor have the {Securities} been acquired with a view to their offer or resale in the EEA where this would result in a requirement for publication by the {Issuer} and the {Manager} or any other manager of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive, or in which the prior consent of the {Managers} has been obtained to such offer or resale.

2.4.sec=The {Issuer} and the {Managers} and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representations, acknowledgements, and agreements. Notwithstanding the above, a person who is not a {Qualified_Investor} and who has notified the {Managers} of such fact in writing may, with the written consent of the {Managers}, be permitted to purchase {Securities}.

2.5.sec=In connection with the issue of the {Bonds}, the “{Stabilizing_Manager}” (or any person acting on behalf of the {Stabilizing_Manager}) may over-allot {Bonds} or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the {Bonds} at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that the {Stabilizing_Manager} (or any person acting on behalf of the {Stabilizing_Manager}) will undertake any stabilisation action. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the {Bonds} is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the {Bonds} and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the {Bonds}. Any stabilisation action or over-allotment must be conducted by the {Stabilizing_Manager} (or any person acting on behalf of the {Stabilizing_Manager}) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules.
