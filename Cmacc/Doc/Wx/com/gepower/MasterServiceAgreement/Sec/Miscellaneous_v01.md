Between the parties, any such electronic documents may be introduced as evidence in any proceedings as business records originated and maintained in paper form. Neither party shall object to the admission of any such electronic document under either the best evidence rule or the business records exception to the hearsay rule. By placing a name or other identifier on any such electronic message, the party doing so intends to sign the message with his/her signature attributed to the message content. The effect of each such message will be determined by the electronic message content and by the law of {Dispute.State.the}, excluding any such law requiring signed agreements or otherwise in conflict with this paragraph.
