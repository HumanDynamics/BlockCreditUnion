iRep.2.Ti=Investment Intent

iRep.2.sec= Such Investor is acquiring the Shares and the Conversion Shares, for investment for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with the view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof, and that such Investor has no present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. Such Investor further represents that it does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person or entity to sell, transfer or grant participation to such person or entity or to any third person or entity with respect to any of the Shares or the Conversion Shares.

iRep.3.Ti=Investment Experience

iRep.3.sec= Such Investor has substantial experience in evaluating and investing in private placement transactions of securities in companies similar to the Company and acknowledges that such Investor can protect its own interests. Such Investor has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so that such Investor is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Company.

iRep.4.Ti=Speculative Nature of Investment

iRep.4.sec= Such Investor understands and acknowledges that the Company has a limited financial and operating history and that an investment in the Company is highly speculative and involves substantial risks. Such Investor can bear the economic risk of such Investor's investment and is able, without impairing such Investor's financial condition, to hold the Shares and the Conversion Shares for an indefinite period of time and to suffer a complete loss of such Investor's investment.

iRep.5.Ti=Access to Data

iRep.5.sec= Such Investor has had an opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from, the officers of the Company concerning the Agreements, the exhibits and schedules attached hereto and thereto and the transactions contemplated by the Agreements, as well as the Company's business, management and financial affairs, which questions were answered to its satisfaction. Such Investor believes that it has received all the information such Investor considers necessary or appropriate for deciding whether to purchase the Shares and the Conversion Shares. Such Investor understands that such discussions, as well as any information issued by the Company, were intended to describe certain aspects of the Company's business and prospects, but were not necessarily a thorough or exhaustive description. Such Investor acknowledges that any business plans prepared by the Company have been, and continue to be, subject to change and that any projections included in such business plans or otherwise are necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Such Investor also acknowledges that it is not relying on any statements or representations of the Company or its agents for legal advice with respect to this investment or the transactions contemplated by the Agreements.

iRep.6.Ti=Accredited Investor

iRep.6.sec= The Investor is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D, Rule 501(a), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act and shall submit to the Company such further assurances of such status as may be reasonably requested by the Company.

iRep.8.sec= Such Investor acknowledges that the Shares and the Conversion Shares must be held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. Such Investor is aware of the provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act which permit limited resale of shares purchased in a private placement subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including among other things, the existence of a public market for the shares, the availability of certain current public information about the Company, the resale occurring not less than one year after a party has purchased and paid for the security to be sold, the sale being effected through a "broker's transaction" or in transactions directly with a "market maker" and the number of shares being sold during any three-month period not exceeding specified limitations. Such Investor understands that the current public information referred to above is not now available and the Company has no present plans to make such information available. Such Investor acknowledges and understands that notwithstanding any obligation under the Rights Agreement, the Company may not be satisfying the current public information requirement of Rule 144 at the time the Investor wishes to sell the Shares or the Conversion Shares, and that, in such event, the Investor may be precluded from selling such securities under Rule 144, even if the other requirements of Rule 144 have been satisfied. Such Investor acknowledges that, in the event all of the requirements of Rule 144 are not met, registration under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration will be required for any disposition of the Shares or the underlying Common Stock. Such Investor understands that, although Rule 144 is not exclusive, the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell restricted securities received in a private offering other than in a registered offering or pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales and that such persons and the brokers who participate in the transactions do so at their own risk.

iRep.9.Ti=No Public Market

iRep.9.sec= Such Investor understands and acknowledges that no public market now exists for any of the securities issued by the Company and that the Company has made no assurances that a public market will ever exist for the Company's securities.

iRep.12.sec=Such Investor has reviewed with its own tax advisors the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by the Agreements.
