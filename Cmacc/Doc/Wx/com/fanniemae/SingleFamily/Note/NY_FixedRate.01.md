NY.Secure.A.tx=Lender may require immediate payment in full of all Sums Secured by this Security Instrument if all or any part of the Property, or if any right in the Property, is sold or transferred without Lender's prior written permission.  If Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred without Lender's prior written permission, Lender also may require immediate payment in full.  However, this option shall not be exercised by Lender if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.

NY.Secure.B.tx=If Lender requires immediate payment in full under this Section {NY.18}, Lender will give me a notice which states this requirement.  The notice will give me at least 30 days to make the required payment. The 30-day period will begin on the date the notice is given to me in the manner required by Section 15 of this Security Instrument.  If I do not make the required payment during that period, Lender may act to enforce its rights under this Security Instrument without giving me any further notice or demand for payment.

<b>Typo in NY doc?</b>= It says "under this Section 18." 

NY.18=18
