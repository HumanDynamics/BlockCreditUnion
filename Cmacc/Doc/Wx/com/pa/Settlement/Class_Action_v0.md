Recital.NoAgreement=Counsel for the Named Parties and Defendant disagree as to whether Defendant has any obligation or liability under {theory of liability} with respect to the claims asserted in the Amended Complaint. 

Recital.Diligence=The Parties have engaged in written discovery and have taken numerous depositions relevant to the facts, claims and potential damages in this matter.  The Parties also filed cross motions for summary judgment and Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, which Defendant opposed.  Prior to oral argument on the pending summary judgment motions and class certification motion, the Parties engaged in settlement negotiations, attempting to avoid further costly litigation and the uncertainties and risks associated therewith.  As a result of these negotiations, the Parties have agreed to enter into this Settlement Agreement, which includes certification of a proposed Settlement Class.  

<b>Oxford Comma</b>=Some instability of usage. 

Recital.Rule23-a/b3=For purposes of this Settlement Agreement only, the Parties agree that the proposed Settlement Class (as defined below) satisfies the requirements of Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Recital.NamedPlaintiffsApprove=The Named Plaintiffs support the settlement of the Action pursuant to the terms of this Settlement Agreement.

<b>Recital.L</b>=slight difference in wording of the fee as between L and I.  Is it correct?

Recital.ClassCounselServiceNeeded=Class Counsel asserts that but for the legal services they provided, they proposed Settlement Class would not have had any recovery on their claims under {theory of liability}.  

Recital.ClassCounselLabored=Class Counsel asserts that they have expended considerable time in prosecuting {theory of liability} claims of the proposed Settlement Class and the legal fees provided herein, equal to {Legal.Fee.%} of the Settlement Amount minus the Service Payments (defined below), plus costs, are fair and reasonable. 

<b>Recital.L</b>=slight difference in wording of the fee as between L and I. And we reference the definition of Service Payments here, rather than earlier.

Recital.AgreeToSettle=The Parties have agreed to fully and finally compromise, settle, and resolve any and all demands, claims, and causes of action, present and future, arising from the Amended Complain, as described below.
