Ti=A blockchain-enable consent system:

1.Ti=Layout

1.1.sec=The consent is a few key/values.  Big things, e.g., an image or the genome itself, is stored off-chain, on IPFS or otherwise, and referenced by hash.

1.2.sec=The consent is signed by the Subject and the Researcher. 

1.3.sec=The form on which it is based is signed by the institution and supervisory authorities. 

1.4.sec=Based on materials signed by i) a national regulator, ii) research funders, iii) the GA4GH, iv) others.

1.5.sec=With each person and institution identified by handle.

2.Ti=Consequences

2.1.sec=A "mostly" machine-readable object model of the study, the field, the consent, the funding, everything one wants.  Mostly machine-readable because most of the information is reduced to metadata - key names. Need to do NLP only for patches, and only until the patches have been tagged.

2.2.sec=Metadata approaches becoming the entire record.

2.3.sec=The critical contribution of blockchain is certainty.  That has many effects.

2.4.sec=Blockchains can be chained.  A system can be satisfied with just one original of each bit of information.  Copies can be discarded because the original is safe.  Shard, share, discard, recharge.
