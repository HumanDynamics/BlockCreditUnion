Ti=Redemption

1.Ti=General

1.sec=Unless prohibited by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders, shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Corporation at a price equal to [the greater of (A)][the Series A Original Issue Price per share, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon][and (B) the Fair Market Value (determined in the manner set forth below) of a single share of Series A Preferred Stock as of the date of the Company’s receipt of the Redemption Request] (the “Redemption Price”), in three (3) annual installments commencing not more than sixty (60) days after receipt by the Corporation at any time on or after [_____________], from the holders of at least [specify percentage] of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, of written notice requesting redemption of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Redemption Request”). Upon receipt of a Redemption Request, the Corporation shall apply all of its assets to any such redemption, and to no other corporate purpose, except to the extent prohibited by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders.  [For purposes of this Subsection 6.1, the Fair Market Value of a single share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be the value of a single share of Series A Preferred Stock as mutually agreed upon by the Company and the holders of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, and, in the event that they are unable to reach agreement, by a third-party appraiser agreed to by the Company and the holders of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding.]  The date of each such installment shall be referred to as a “Redemption Date.”  On each Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by each holder, that number of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies)[; provided, however, that Excluded Shares (as such term is defined in Subsection 6.2) shall not be redeemed and shall be excluded from the calculations set forth in this sentence].  If on any Redemption Date Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders prevents the Corporation from redeeming all shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, the Corporation shall ratably redeem the maximum number of shares that it may redeem consistent with such law, and shall redeem the remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under such law.

2.Ti=Redemption Notice

2.0.sec=The Corporation shall send written notice of the mandatory redemption (the “Redemption Notice”) to each holder of record of Series A Preferred Stock not less than forty (40) days prior to each Redemption Date.  Each Redemption Notice shall state:

2.1.sec=(a)	the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by the holder that the Corporation shall redeem on the Redemption Date specified in the Redemption Notice;

2.2.sec=(b)	the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price;

2.3.sec=(c)	the date upon which the holder’s right to convert such shares terminates (as determined in accordance with Subsection 4.1); and

2.4.sec=(d)	for holders of shares in certificated form, that the holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

2.90.sec=[If the Corporation receives, on or prior to the twentieth (20th) day after the date of delivery of the Redemption Notice to a holder of Series A Preferred Stock, written notice from such holder that such holder elects to be excluded from the redemption provided in this Section 6, then the shares of Series A Preferred Stock registered on the books of the Corporation in the name of such holder at the time of the Corporation’s receipt of such notice shall thereafter be “Excluded Shares.”  Excluded Shares shall not be redeemed or redeemable pursuant to this Section 6, whether on such Redemption Date or thereafter.]

3.Ti=Surrender of Certificates; Payment

3.sec=On or before the applicable Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date, unless such holder has exercised his, her or its right to convert such shares as provided in Section 4, shall, if a holder of shares in certificated form, surrender the certificate or certificates representing such shares (or, if such registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon the Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof.  In the event less than all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate, instrument, or book entry representing the unredeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall promptly be issued to such holder.

4.Ti=Rights Subsequent to Redemption

4.sec=If the Redemption Notice shall have been duly given, and if on the applicable Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon redemption of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such Redemption Date is paid or tendered for payment or deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor in a timely manner, then notwithstanding that any certificates evidencing any of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, dividends with respect to such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue after such Redemption Date and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the Redemption Date terminate, except only the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon surrender of any such  certificate or certificates therefor.
