Ti=Footnote 56

sec=Examples of giving priority to reducing activity concentrations of <sup>222</sup>Rn in those situations for which such action is likely to be most effective include (i) specifying the levels of activity concentrations of <sup>222</sup>Rn in dwellings and other buildings with high occupancy factors at which protection can be considered optimized; (ii) identifying radon prone areas; (iii) identifying characteristics of buildings that are likely to give rise to elevated activity concentrations of <sup>222</sup>Rn; and (iv) identifying and requiring preventive measures for radon in future buildings that can be introduced at relatively low cost.
