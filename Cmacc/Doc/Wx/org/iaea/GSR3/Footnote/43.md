Ti=Footnote 43

sec=The diagnostic or therapeutic benefit that medical exposures are expected to yield may not necessarily be to the person exposed. For patients, this is clearly the case, but for exposures in biomedical research the benefit is expected to be for biomedical sciences and for future health care. Similarly, the benefit for carers and comforters might be, for example, the successful performance of a diagnostic procedure on a child.
