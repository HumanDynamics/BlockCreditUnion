Ti=Footnote 29

sec=A generic safety assessment is usually sufficient for types of source with a high degree of uniformity in design. A specific safety assessment is usually required in other cases; however, the specific safety assessment need not include those aspects covered by a generic safety assessment, if a generic safety assessment has been conducted for the type of source. Requirements for the optimization of medical exposure are specified in paras 3.162â€“3.177.
