Ti=Footnote 25

sec=For occupational exposure, the relevant dose constraint is on individual doses to workers, established and used by registrants and licensees to set the range of options in optimizing protection and safety for the source. For public exposure, the relevant dose constraint is a source related value established or approved by the government or the regulatory body, with account taken of the doses from planned operations of all sources under control. The dose constraint for each particular source is intended, among other things, to ensure that the sum of doses from planned operations for all sources under control remains within the dose limit.
