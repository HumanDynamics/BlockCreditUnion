sec=For example, a sterilization gamma irradiation unit is a source for the practice of radiation preservation of food. An X ray unit may be a source for the practice of radiodiagnosis. A nuclear power plant is part of the practice of generating electricity by nuclear fission, and may be regarded as a single source (e.g. with respect to discharges) or as a collection of sources (e.g. for purposes of occupational radiation protection). A complex or multiple installation situated at one location or site may, as appropriate, be considered a single source for the purposes of application of these Standards.
