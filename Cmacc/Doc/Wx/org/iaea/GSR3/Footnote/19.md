Ti=Footnote 19

sec=Typical practices that are suitable for registration are those for which: (i) safety can largely be ensured by the design of the facilities and equipment; (ii) the operating procedures are simple to follow; (iii) the training requirements for safety are minimal; and (iv) there is a history of few problems relating to safety in operations. Registration is best suited to those practices for which operations do not vary significantly.
