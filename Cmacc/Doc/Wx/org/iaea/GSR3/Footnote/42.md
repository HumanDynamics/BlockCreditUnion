Ti=Footnote 42

sec=‘The appropriate area’ means, in the first instance, diagnostic radiology, image guided interventional procedures, or radiation therapy or nuclear medicine (diagnostic radiological procedures, therapeutic radiological procedures or both). The area of specialization is often likely to be narrower, however, in particular with regard to the radiological medical practitioner. Examples are dental, chiropractic or podiatric specialists in the case of diagnostic radiology, and cardiologists, urologists or neurologists in the case of image guided interventional procedures.
