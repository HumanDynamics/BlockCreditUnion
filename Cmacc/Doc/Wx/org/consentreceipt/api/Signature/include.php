Playing with notion of minimum viable signature (or consent?).
<br>
A "consent" is, at root, i) a signature, ii) at a time, iii) by a person, iv) given to another person (it is "personal" rather than "real" in the civil law sense), v) relating to something.  Circumstances can require additional elements or details.  For instance, where a signature was done can matter for legal purposes.  So can the age of a person, bankruptcy status, infirmity, jurisdiction and regime of organization, bylaws, etc.  It might be necessary to have them recite something first, or to have been told something first.  There may be a reconsideration period (the signature/consent may be in suspense until passing of a day, or a week, etc.)
<br>
A signature can be given on behalf of the person signing, or on behalf of another person (e.g., an officer signing for a company, a fiduciary signing for a ward).
<br>
Two (or more) persons signing can be handled as one person then the other, with the first conditional on the second, or as joint authorship of a single document.  In this example, it is done as two separate documents.
<br>
We could use more expressive names, but shorter ones are easy to use in the document text.  TBDebated.
<br>
In each case, the "identity" (here a filename) of the "person" may be a hash or other unique string.
