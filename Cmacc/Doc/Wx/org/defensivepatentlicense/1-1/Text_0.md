Ti=License

0.sec=NOTICE: ALL RIGHTS IN LICENSED PATENTS (as defined below) PROVIDED UNDER THIS DEFENSIVE PATENT LICENSE ("DPL") ARE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH BELOW. MAKING, USING, SELLING, OFFERING FOR SALE, IMPORTING, OR DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES EMBODYING THE LICENSED PATENTS, OTHER THAN AS EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR PATENT LAW, IS PROHIBITED.

1.Ti=License Grant

1.0.sec=Subject to the conditions and limitations of this License, Licensor hereby grants and agrees to grant to any DPL User (as defined in Section 7.6) who follows the procedures for License Acceptance (as defined in Section 1.1) a worldwide, royalty-free, no-charge, non-exclusive, irrevocable (except as stated in Sections 2(e) and 2(f)) license, perpetual for the term of the relevant Licensed Patents, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and distribute Licensed Products and Services that would otherwise infringe any claim of Licensed Patents. A Licensee's sale of Licensed Products and Services pursuant to this agreement exhausts the Licensor's ability to assert infringement against a downstream purchaser or user of the Licensed Products or Services. Licensor's obligation to grant Licenses under this provision ceases upon the arrival of any applicable Discontinuation Date, unless that Date is followed by a subsequent Offering Announcement.

1.1.Ti=License Acceptance

1.1.sec=In order to accept this License, Licensee must qualify as a DPL User (as defined in Section 7.6) and must contact Licensor via the information provided in Licensor's Offering Announcement to state affirmatively that Licensee accepts the terms of this License. Licensee must also communicate the URL of its own Offering Announcement (as defined in Section 7.13) and specify whether it is accepting the License to all Licensor's Patents or only a subset of those Patents. If Licensee is only accepting the License to a subset of Licensor's Patents, Licensee must specify each individual Patent's country of issuance and corresponding patent number for which it is accepting a License. There is no requirement that the Licensor respond to the Licensee's affirmative acceptance of this License.

2.5.2.sec=Licensee assigns, transfers, or grants an exclusive license for a Patent to an entity or individual other than a DPL User without conditioning the assignment, transfer, or exclusive license on the recipient continuing to abide by the terms of this License, including but not limited to the revocation and termination rights under this Section.

No other terms in the license may be altered in any way under this provision.
