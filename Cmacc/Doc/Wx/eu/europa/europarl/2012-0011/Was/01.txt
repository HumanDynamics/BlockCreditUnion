PRINCIPLES

Article 5

Principles relating to personal data processing

Personal data must be:

.1.sec=processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject;

.2.sec=collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes;

.3.sec=adequate, relevant, and limited to the minimum necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed; they shall only be processed if, and as long as, the purposes could not be fulfilled by processing information that does not involve personal data;

.4.sec=accurate and kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay;

.5.sec=kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the data will be processed solely for historical, statistical or scientific research purposes in accordance with the rules and conditions of Article 83 and if a periodic review is carried out to assess the necessity to continue the storage; (f) processed under the responsibility and liability of the controller, who shall ensure and demonstrate for each processing operation the compliance with the provisions of this Regulation.

Article 6

Lawfulness of processing

1.sec=Processing of personal data shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:

1.1.sec=the data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes;

1.2.sec=processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;

1.3.sec=processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;

1.4.sec=processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject;

1.5.sec=processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by a controller, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. This shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.

2.sec=Processing of personal data which is necessary for the purposes of historical, statistical or scientific research shall be lawful subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 83.

3.sec=The basis of the processing referred to in points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 must be provided for in:

The law of the Member State must meet an objective of public interest or must be necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of others, respect the essence of the right to the protection of personal data and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.

4.sec=Where the purpose of further processing is not compatible with the one for which the personal data have been collected, the processing must have a legal basis at least in one of the grounds referred to in points (a) to (e) of paragraph 1.

3.sec=The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

4.sec=Consent shall not provide a legal basis for the processing, where there is a significant imbalance between the position of the data subject and the controller.

Article 8

Processing of personal data of a child

1.sec=For the purposes of this Regulation, in relation to the offering of information society services directly to a child, the processing of personal data of a child below the age of 13 years shall only be lawful if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the child's parent or custodian.
