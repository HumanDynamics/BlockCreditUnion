To facilitate payment and verification, Seller and BPA shall keep all books and records necessary for billing and payments in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 and grant the other Party reasonable access to those records.

(f) Examination of Records

Seller and BPA may examine the billing and operating records and data kept by the other relating to transactions under, and administration of, this Agreement at any time during the period the records are required to be maintained, upon request and during normal business hours.

13. Dispute Resolution

(a) The Parties shall make a good faith effort to negotiate a resolution of disputes before initiating litigation. During a contract dispute or contract issue between the Parties arising out of this Agreement, the Parties shall continue performance under this Agreement pending resolution of the dispute, unless to do so would be impossible or impracticable. Seller reserves the right to seek judicial resolution of any dispute arising under this Agreement that is not subject to arbitration under this Section 13.

(b) Final actions subject to section 9(e) of the Northwest Power Act are not subject to binding arbitration and shall remain within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Any dispute regarding any rights of the Parties under any BPA policy, including the implementation of such policy, shall not be subject to arbitration under this Agreement. Seller reserves the right to seek judicial resolution of any dispute arising under this Agreement that is not subject to arbitration under this Section 13. For purposes of this Section 13, BPA policy means any written document adopted by BPA as a final action in a decision record or record of decision that establishes a policy of general application, or makes a determination under an applicable statute. If either Party asserts that a dispute is excluded from arbitration under this Section 13, either Party may apply to the Federal court having jurisdiction for an order determining whether such dispute is subject to arbitration under this Section 13.

(c) Any contract dispute or contract issue between the Parties arising out of this Agreement, except for disputes that are excluded through Section 13(a) above, shall be subject to binding arbitration. The Parties shall make a good faith effort to resolve such disputes before initiating arbitration proceedings. During arbitration, the Parties shall continue performance under this Agreement pending resolution of the dispute, unless to do so would be impossible or impracticable.

(d) Any arbitration shall take place in Portland, Oregon, unless the Parties agree otherwise. The CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution’s arbitration procedures for commercial arbitration, Non-Administered Arbitration Rules (CPR Rules), shall be used for each dispute; provided, however, that: (1) the Parties shall have the discovery rights provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure unless the Parties agree otherwise; and (2) for claims of $1 million or more, each arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three neutral arbitrators. The Parties shall select the arbitrators from a list containing the names of 15 qualified individuals supplied by the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution. If the Parties cannot agree upon three arbitrators on the list within 20 Business Days, the Parties shall take turns striking names from the list of proposed arbitrators. The Party initiating the arbitration shall take the first strike. This process shall be repeated until three arbitrators remain on the list, and those individuals shall be designated as the arbitrators. For disputes involving less than $1 million, a single neutral arbitrator shall be selected consistent with section 6 of the CPR Rules.

(e) Except for arbitration awards, which declare the rights and duties of the Parties under this Agreement, the payment of monies shall be the exclusive remedy available in any arbitration proceeding. Under no circumstances shall specific performance be an available remedy against BPA. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on both Parties, except that either Party may seek judicial review based upon any of the grounds referred to in the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1-16 (1988). Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.

(f) Each Party shall be responsible for its own costs of arbitration, including legal fees. The arbitrators may apportion all other costs of arbitration between the Parties in such manner as they deem reasonable taking into account the circumstances of the case, the conduct of the Parties during the proceeding, and the result of the arbitration.

14. Force Majeure

(a) Definition of Force Majeure

The term “Force Majeure,” as used in this Agreement, means causes or events beyond the reasonable control of, and without the fault or negligence of the party claiming Force Majeure, including, without limitation, acts of God, sudden actions of the elements such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, wind speeds in excess of safe working limits, or tornadoes; sabotage; vandalism beyond that which could reasonably be prevented by Seller; terrorism; war; riots; fire; explosion; severe cold or hot weather or snow or other extreme or severe weather conditions; blockage, insurrection, strike, slow down, or labor disruptions (even if such difficulties could be resolved by conceding to the demands of a labor group); and requirements, actions or failures to act by Transmission System Operator, but only if such requirements, actions or failures to act prevent or delay performance; the adoption or change in any rule or regulation or judicial decision lawfully imposed by Federal, state, or local government bodies; inability, despite due diligence, to obtain required licenses, permits, or approvals for the construction and operation of the Facility under the terms of this Agreement; and the mechanical or equipment breakdown of the Grid to the extent not caused by the party claiming the Force Majeure. The term “Force Majeure” does not include any full or partial curtailment in the electric output of the Facility that is caused by or arises from the act or acts of any third party, including, without limitation, any vendor, materialman, customer, or supplier of Seller, unless such act or acts is or are itself or themselves excused by reason of Force Majeure. The term “Force Majeure” does not include any full or partial curtailment in the electric output of the Facility that is caused by or arises from a mechanical or equipment breakdown of the Facility, or fires, explosions, or other mishap or events or conditions attributable to normal wear and tear or flaws related to the Facility, unless caused by a Force Majeure event specifically listed in the first sentence of this Section 14(a).

(b) Applicability of Force Majeure

Neither Party shall be responsible or liable for any delay or failure in its performance under this Agreement due to conditions or events of Force Majeure (except that any and all obligations to pay money shall not be delayed or excused by conditions or events of Force Majeure), provided that:

(1) the non-performing Party gives the other Party prompt written notice describing the particulars of the occurrence of the Force Majeure;

(2) the suspension of performance is of no greater scope and of no longer duration than is required by the Force Majeure;

(3) the non-performing Party proceeds with reasonable diligence to remedy its inability to perform and provides weekly progress reports to the other Party describing actions taken to end the Force Majeure; and

(4) the non-performing Party shall provide written notice of its ability to resume performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

(c) Limitations on Effect of Force Majeure

In no event will any delay or failure of performance caused by any conditions or events of Force Majeure extend this Agreement beyond its stated term. In the event of any delay or failure of performance caused by conditions or events of Force Majeure, which would otherwise constitute an Event of Default pursuant to Section 10, the cure provisions of Section 10 shall not apply and such delay or failure of performance, if not previously cured, shall be extended day-for-day by the event of Force Majeure; provided that such delay or failure shall become an Event of Default one (1) year from the date of notice provided for in Section 10. The other Party may, at any time following the end of such one-year period, terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the affected Party, without further obligation by the terminating Party except as to costs and unpaid balances incurred prior to the effective date of such termination. The other Party may, but shall not be obligated to, extend such one year period, for such additional time as it, at its sole discretion, deems appropriate, if the affected Party is exercising due diligence in its efforts to cure the conditions or events of Force Majeure.

(d) Delays Attributable to BPA

Seller shall be excused from delays in meeting performance deadlines under this Agreement, on a day-for-day basis, for any delays attributable to BPA, including, without limitation, delays in BPA obtaining any required permits, consents, or approvals and agreements, including, without limitation, the Delivery Arrangements Agreement, from governmental authorities or third parties required for BPA to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Seller shall provide BPA with timely written notice that a delay allegedly attributable to BPA has occurred or is expected to occur. The notice shall specify the length of any extension to a performance deadline to which Seller feels entitled.
