This demo will show record-keeping for the collection and transfer of biological samples.  It will also show managed access to the information relating to the sample. 

<br>
The terms of the MTA are established in /Dx/MIT/01-MaterialsTransfer/CoverPage.md.
<br>
The CoverPage is used to create a specific MTA for each sample, as /Dx/MIT/01-MaterialsTransfer/Sample_1.md, et seq.
<br>
Each specific MTA references a file of metadata associated with the sample by a GUID. In /U/is/Tissue/ABCD5E/*.

<br><br>
The example can be deepened by reflecting the stages of the negotiation and signature, and by a succession of communications following transfer.  
<br>
These materials can be hypothetically interrogated by a third party authorized by the Donor or the Scientist.
