Playing around with a faux hash system for file naming.  

<br> 

Each bit of work is saved as a file whose name is a hash of the file.  The file also contains the previous state of the document in the form of a =[2s4TiZ7dE..] link to the previous state. The new file could contain only the modified key/values (for this we need to add a formal way of eliminating a key/value).  This would happen automatically in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZfsyTPYFIA">Xray editing view</a> since only the edits are created by the user interaction.

Here are a few pretend hashes (numbered sequentially to make it easier on me).
