Ti=Bespoke Dispute Resolution

1.sec=Dispute resolution is a critical part of a transaction platform and the core of the legal function.  It is the equivalent of error handling.  A good dispute resolution solution makes things upstream work better.

2.sec=It's core function is to apply human judgment to a situation that was unanticipated.

3.sec=To be effective, a dispute resolution system must be able to get to a decision on the merits rapidly and cheaply.  It should be alert to manipulation.

4.sec=If parties can plan efficiently and there is a mechanism for aggregating experience, then the dispute resolution process can be shaped by experience, following and forking at the planning layer.

5.0.sec=Disputes can be reduced in number and difficulty of resolution by:

5.1.sec=Clarifying the deal that the parties have agreed (layer one)

5.2.sec=Promptness of declaring the difficulty

5.3.sec=Evidence that is immediately available and relatively uncluttered
