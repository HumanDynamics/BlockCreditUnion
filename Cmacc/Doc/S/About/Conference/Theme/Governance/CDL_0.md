Ti=Organi{s/z}ation of {df.CDL}

1.sec=CommonAccord is a fundamentally decentrali{s/z}ed system.  There is no need for a hub.  The fit with decentrali{s/z}ed transacting platforms like blockchain is explored at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eizIqpx_ni8KaGkk3bVKvBBDoRy2eTEtvPHE0hiar7c/edit">Decentralized Law and the Blockchain</a>. It is also light-weight.  The current system is hosted on GitHub and presented via Heroku, for free, using accounts that anyone can open.  The system can be installed privately by anyone, anywhere on a "LAMP" stack, or now <a href="https://github.com/CommonAccord/Cmacc-Tech/blob/master/README">on Docker</a>.  One can host files on any system, including Mediawiki.  There is no technical need for a "center." 

2.sec=Law, however, is fundamentally social, and harmoni{s/z}ation of rules (codification) is one of its most ancient and effective methods.  Some social and business problems require harmoni{s/z}ed solutions, and there is a large body of knowledge about legal codification and communities that do it well.

3.sec=Accordingly, it seems useful to have an organi{s/z}ation, perhaps a "{df.CDL}," that will act as fiduciary for a {df.PDS} that is a set of materials for the global aspects of codification.  This will be an assortment of legal forms, widgets, and software code, like the current site at commonaccord.org and github.com/commonaccord/Cmacc-Org.

4.sec=As a starting point for discussion, the {df.CDL} should be not-for-profit, based in civil society (rather than government), very light-weight, focused on supporting the community of coders, both legal and software.  The "Cmacc" format should be submitted to a technical standards procedure.  When a new parser is written, it should also be subject to a formal codification.  Most of the rest should remain a matter of free choice and competition.  

5.sec=The {df.CDL}'s budget will likely be from donations, though micropayments could be explored.
