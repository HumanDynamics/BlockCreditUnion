Ti=Textual Conductivity

0.sec=Let us imagine that legal text has a characteristic of conductivity.  It's conductivity is proportional to how well it is understood well by the relevant community.  

1.sec="Understood" means that the text has a precise, fixed meaning.  Of course this is not easy to measure and subject to surprises.  But usually, the level of "understanding" will be proportional to how often it has been read by persons relevant to the situation.  
2.sec=The relevant community most notably includes the parties and the person(s) who will decide any argument about the meaning of the text.  Often the relevant reading will be done by persons associated with these actors.  For the parties, by their lawyers, a trade association, or their peers.  For the adjudicator, this may be other judges, scholars, commentators, and lawyers for the parties.  

3.sec=To reinforce the image, imagine that text when first written is hot, and that each reading reduces its temperature.  A bit of heat has been conducted away, the text dances around a bit less.  With more readings, it becomes colder. Of course this requires that the readings are connected, that the provenance of the text is known and the readings can be connected. 

4.sec=Contrary to physics, but helpful to the image, let us imagine that as the temperature declines the conductivity increases.  As the community that has read the text expands, the text becomes low resistance, conducive to rapid dealings.  

5.sec=Another, perhaps better image, is that new text is a thin wire connecting the parties.  Each reading fattens the wire, reducing its resistance, enabling it to carry more transactions.
