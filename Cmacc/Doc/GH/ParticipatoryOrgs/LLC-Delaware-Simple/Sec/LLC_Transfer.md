1.Ti=Transfer and Assignment of Interests

1.sec=A Member may encumber that Member's interest with the prior approval of a Majority Interest of the other Members.  Any encumbrance of a Member's Interest will be null and void unless approved by a Majority Interest of the other Members. The Company will dissolve upon any Member's transfer (other than a transfer that is a prior approved encumbrance) of any portion of that Member's interest.

2.Ti=Substitution of Members

2.sec=A transferee of a Membership Interest will have the right to become a substitute Member only if (1) consent of all of the Members is given in their sole discretion, (2) such person executes an instrument satisfactory to the Members accepting and adopting the terms and provisions of this agreement, and (3) that person pays any reasonable expenses in connection with the transferee's admission as a new Member. The admission of a substitute Member will not release the Member who assigned the Membership Interest from any liability that the Member has to the Company.
