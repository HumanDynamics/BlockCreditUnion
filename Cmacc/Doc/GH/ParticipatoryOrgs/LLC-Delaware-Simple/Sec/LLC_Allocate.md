2.Ti=Special Allocations

2.1.sec=In order to comply with the "qualified income offset" requirement of Regulations under Code section 704(b), and notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to the contrary except as provided in section {Xnum}.2(b) and section {Xnum}.2(e), in the event a Member for any reason (whether or not expected) has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, items of profit (consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of income comprising the Company's profits, including both gross income and gain for the taxable year) will be allocated to that Member in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate as quickly as possible the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit.

2.2.sec=In order to comply with the "minimum gain chargeback" requirements of Regulations sections 1.704-2(f)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(4), and notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to the contrary, except section {Xnum}.2(e), in the event there is a net decrease in a Member's share of Company Minimum Gain or Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during a Company taxable year, that Member will be allocated items of income and gain for that year (and, if necessary, other years) as required by and in accordance with Regulations sections 1.704-2(f)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(4) before any other allocation is made.

2.3.sec=For purposes of determining the character (as ordinary income or capital gain) of any taxable income of the Company allocated to the Members pursuant to this section {Xnum}.2, such portion of the taxable income of the Company allocated pursuant to this section {Xnum}.2 which is treated as ordinary income attributable to the recapture of depreciation will, to the extent possible, be allocated among the Members in the proportion that (1) the amount of depreciation previously allocated to each Member bears to (2) the total of such depreciation allocated to all Members. This section {Xnum}.2 will not alter the amount of allocations among the Members pursuant to section {Xnum}.1, but merely the character of income so allocated.

2.4.sec=Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any Member's Percentage Interest changes during a Fiscal Year for any reason, including the transfer of any interest in the Company, the Managers shall adjust (in a manner the Managers deem appropriate) such allocations of taxable income or loss as necessary to reflect the varying interests of the Members during such year.

2.5.sec=Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) in the event Code section 704(c) or Code section 704(c) principles applicable under Regulations section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) require allocations of income or loss of the Company in a manner different than that set forth above, the provisions of Code section 704(c) and the Regulations thereunder will control those allocations among the Members; and (2) all tax deductions and taxable losses of the Company that, pursuant to Regulations section 1.704-2(i), are attributable to a Member Nonrecourse Debt for which a Member (or a Person related to that Member under Regulations section 1.752-4(b)) bears the economic risk of loss (within the meaning of Regulations section 1.752-2), will be allocated to that Member as required by Regulations section 1.704-2(c). Any item of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any property (other than cash) that has been contributed by a Member to the capital of the Company or which has been revalued for Capital Account purposes pursuant to Regulations section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and which is required or permitted to be allocated to that Member for income tax purposes under Code section 704(c) so as to take into account the variation between the tax basis of that property and its fair market value at the time of its contribution shall be allocated solely for income tax purposes in the manner so required or permitted under Code section 704(c) using any method selected by the Managers and the contributing Member that is properly permitted under Regulations section 1.704-3.

2.6.sec=Except for arrangements expressly described in this agreement, no Member shall enter into (or permit any Person related to the Member to enter into) any arrangement with respect to any liability of the Company that would result in that Member (or a Person related to that Member pursuant to Regulations section 1.752-4(b)) bearing the economic risk of loss (within the meaning of Regulations section 1.752-2) with respect to that liability unless the Managers have approved that arrangement. This section {Xnum}.2(f) shall not prohibit any Member of the Company from satisfying the Member's obligation under state law to pay monies owed to any creditor of the Company on account of the Company's obligations. To the extent a Member is permitted to guarantee the repayment of any Company indebtedness under this agreement, each of the other Members will be afforded the opportunity to guarantee that Member's pro rata share of that indebtedness, determined in accordance with the Members' respective Percentage Interests.

2.7.sec=The parties intend that the foregoing tax allocation provisions of this section {Xnum}.2 will produce final Capital Account balances that will permit liquidating distributions, that are made in accordance with final Capital Account balances under section 9.3, to be made (after unpaid loans and interest thereon, including those owed to Members, have been paid) in a manner identical to the priorities set forth in section 9.3. To the extent that the tax allocation provisions of this section {Xnum}.2 would fail to produce such final Capital Account balances, (1) such provisions will be amended by the Members if and to the extent necessary to produce such result, and (2) items of income, loss or deduction of the Company for prior open years will be reallocated among the Members to the extent it is impossible to achieve such result with allocations of items of income (including gross income) and deduction for the current year and future years. This Section {Xnum}.2(f) will control notwithstanding any reallocation or adjustment of income, loss, deduction or items thereof by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

3.Ti=Excess Nonrecourse Liability Allocation

3.sec=Pursuant to Regulations section 1.752-3(a)(3), solely for purposes of determining each Member's proportionate share of the "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of the Company (as defined in Regulations section 1.752-3(a)(3)), the Members' respective interests in the Company's profits will be the Members' respective Percentage Interests.
