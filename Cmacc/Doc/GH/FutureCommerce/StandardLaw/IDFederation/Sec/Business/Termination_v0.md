A Participant shall reasonably participate in such discussions. If, upon discussion of the matter, there is good cause to believe that a Participant is in violation of the Rules of this Trust Framework, the following consequences may be pursued.

2.1.Ti=Warning

2.1.sec=The Policy Authority or the Federation Operator may provide a warning to a Participant for violation of the Rules of this Trust Framework.

2.2.sec=In the event the Policy Authority believes the discussions described in Section 1.04(b) have not resulted in resolution of the violation of the Rules of this Trust Framework by a Participant within the time frame to cure noted in the warning, and the Participant that has been warned asserts it is in fact in compliance, then the Policy Authority may request that the Participant’s President, CEO, COO, or senior employee of the Participant who is directly involved with the ID Federation be reasonably available for purposes of resolving the matter. The Participant may present evidence in its discretion in support of its compliance with the Trust Framework.

2.3.Ti=Suspension

2.3.sec=The Policy Authority may suspend a Participant for violation of the Rules of this Trust Framework. As determined by the Policy Authority, a notice of suspension may be effective immediately–in the case of a serious violation threatening the security of the ID Federation or the rights or property of any Participant in the ID Federation (in the sole discretion of the Policy Authority)-or the suspension may be effective after a notice period and an opportunity to cure. A notice of suspension shall be delivered in writing by the Federation Operator to the business and technical contacts identified by the Participant. The notice of suspension shall include a description of the violation, a description of the corrective action or actions sought, and a time frame within which to cure the violations. During the suspension term, the Participant shall be removed from the Participant Directory, including information about any Certified Service of the Participant. Members of the ID Federation shall be given notice of the suspension of the Party’s Participation in the ID Federation. Any suspension longer than one (1) year shall be considered an involuntary termination.

In either instance, the Policy Authority may involuntarily terminate the Participant with thirty (30) days written notice.

2.4.Ti=Involuntary Termination

2.4.sec=The Policy Authority may cause a Participant to be involuntarily terminated for serious violation of the Rules of this Trust Framework (in the sole discretion of the Policy Authority).

A notice of termination shall be delivered in writing by the Policy Authority to the Business and Technical Contacts for the Participant. The notice of termination shall include a description of the violation and, if applicable, a description of the corrective action or actions sought and a time frame within which to cure the violations.
