Appendix C

Ti=Antitrust Policy

0.1.sec=Those participating in ID Federation activities of any type should be aware of the need to exercise caution to avoid inadvertent violations of EU, international, national or state/province antitrust and anticompetitive laws. Violations of such laws can result in severe civil penalties (and in some jurisdictions, criminal penalties) for individuals as well as their employers.

0.2.sec=Laws relating to antitrust and anticompetitive behavior can be quite complex, and differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Consequently, it is not possible to summarize them in this policy, and you should therefore consult appropriate advisors at your own company for detailed guidance.

0.3.sec=The following rules shall apply in connection with all ID Federation meetings, activities, and other forms of participation:

4.sec=If at any time you become aware of any activity that may be in violation of any of the above rules, please bring them promptly to the attention of an ID Federation representative.

90.sec=REMEMBER: All ID Federation activities must serve to promote, rather than restrict, competition to the benefit of consumers and the marketplace. Activities that do otherwise, or even appear to have the potential to do otherwise, may have serious consequences.
