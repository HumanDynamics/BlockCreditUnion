RY 2014 Hospital-Determined Presumptive Eligibility RFA 3/21/2014

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) is issuing this Request for Applications (RFA) to solicit applications from Hospitals that elect to perform presumptive eligibility determinations for certain individuals that, on the basis of preliminary information, appear to be eligible for MassHealth coverage.
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) allows Hospitals to make presumptive eligibility determinations for temporary coverage using self-attested information from certain individuals who appear to be eligible for Medicaid coverage.
With this RFA, MassHealth seeks applications from Hospitals that wish to make presumptive eligibility determinations under the ACA. Upon receipt of applications to this RFA, EOHHS shall evaluate each submission based on the criteria set forth in this RFA. Upon EOHHS’ approval of a Hospital’s application, the Hospital and the EOHHS shall execute a MassHealth Hospital- Determined Presumptive Eligibility Contract. The non-financial Contract will remain valid until either party terminates the Contract or the Hospital is disqualified from making presumptive eligibility determinations, whichever occurs first. EOHHS reserves the right to terminate this agreement immediately without notice if it determines that any material term of the Contract has been violated.
The following terms appearing capitalized throughout this RFA and its appendices shall be defined as follows, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.Affordable Care Act (ACA) — the informal term for the two federal statutes known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub.

Qualified Hospital (or Contractor) — a Hospital that submits a satisfactory application in response to this RFA and enters into a MassHealth Hospital-Determined Presumptive Eligibility Contract with EOHHS to make MassHealth presumptive eligibility determinations pursuant to the ACA, 42 CFR 435.1110 and governing state regulations, policies and procedures.
Satellite Clinic — a facility that operates under a Hospital’s license, is subject to the fiscal, administrative, and clinical management of the Hospital, provides services to Members solely on an outpatient basis, is not located at the same site as the Hospital’s inpatient facility, and demonstrates to EOHHS’ satisfaction that it has CMS provider-based status in accordance with 42 CFR 413.65.
State-developed Performance Standards –metrics developed by EOHHS regarding submission of applications for full MassHealth benefits and the outcome of such applications and other measures designed to evaluate Hospitals’ presumptive eligibility performance as they may be updated from time to time.
Hospitals must be “Qualified Hospitals” to perform presumptive eligibility determinations. In
order to be considered qualified, a Hospital must:
1. Use only properly trained CACs on-site at a Hospital location to assist Hospitals in making presumptive eligibility determinations.
2. Notify EOHHS of its election to make presumptive eligibility determinations in accordance with EOHHS policy and guidelines;
3. Agree to make presumptive eligibility determinations in accordance with federal and state statutes, regulations, policies and procedures, including training requirements and, if a Hospital uses third party contractors, the requirement in 42 CFR 435.1102(b)(2)(vi) that a Hospital cannot “delegate the authority to determine presumptive eligibility to another entity”;
4. Agree to have CACs available to assist individuals to complete and submit a full MassHealth Application as described in 130 CMR 502.001 in accordance with all applicable requirements; and
5. Not be disqualified by EOHHS from making presumptive eligibility determinations.
A Hospital that seeks to participate but does not meet all of the above requirements will not be approved to make presumptive eligibility determinations.
In determining whether a Hospital satisfies the requirements set forth in Section III, EOHHS may evaluate, pursuant to an on-site audit or otherwise, a number of factors including, but not limited to, State-developed Performance Standards.
A Hospital must notify EOHHS of its election to make presumptive eligibility determinations by submitting an Application in response to this RFA. The enrollment process will remain open under this RFA. Hospitals must return a signed agreement and participate in any training necessary prior to making presumptive eligibility determinations.
Prior to performing any presumptive eligibility determinations, Hospitals that elect to perform presumptive eligibility determinations and their CACs will be required to participate in training sessions that are administered by EOHHS. Hospitals are required to maintain records of the names of CACs and their CAC training status as set forth in the Contract. CACs will use the HPE Application and presumptive eligibility notices provided by EOHHS. CACs will be required to offer assistance to individuals who are determined presumptively eligible in completing a full MassHealth Application for coverage.
EOHHS will monitor and track each Qualified Hospital’s implementation of presumptive eligibility determinations using State-developed Performance Standards regarding submission of applications for full MassHealth benefits and the outcome of such applications. The Qualified Hospital will provide the data specified by EOHHS on performance indicators to assist EOHHS in monitoring compliance with the performance standards. The data will be submitted in accordance with EOHHS directions and timeframes.
MassHealth will monitor two measures to ensure that Hospitals are making presumptive eligibility determinations in a judicious manner. The details of performance measurement are provided in the contract. EOHHS will work with Hospitals that do not meet the standards to provide additional training, and, if necessary, develop and implement corrective action plans.
When conducting presumptive eligibility determinations, the Qualified Hospital will rely on information provided by applicants. It will not require or request any documentation or verification of the information, nor will it require any information that is not needed for a presumptive eligibility determination.
The Qualified Hospital will use a simplified measure of an individual’s household and income to make presumptive eligibility determinations. It will require applicants to attest to their citizenship or immigration status and residency when completing the HPE Application.
Hospitals may make presumptive eligibility determinations for:
• Children aged 0-18 and young adults aged 19-20 eligible for MassHealth Standard
• Pregnant women eligible for MassHealth Standard
• Former foster care youth up to age 26 eligible for MassHealth Standard
• Adults aged 21-64 eligible for MassHealth CarePlus
• Parents or other caretaker relatives eligible for MassHealth Standard
• Uninsured individuals with breast or cervical cancer eligible for MassHealth Standard
• HIV positive individuals eligible for MassHealth Standard or HIV-Family Assistance
• Children who are non-qualified permanent residents under color of law (PRUCOLs) eligible
6
for MassHealth Family Assistance
Individuals found presumptively eligible will receive the MassHealth coverage for which they appear eligible (i.e., MassHealth Standard, MassHealth CarePlus, or MassHealth Family Assistance). No presumptive eligibility is offered for other MassHealth coverage including, but not limited to, MassHealth Limited and Health Safety Net.
Once an individual is approved or denied presumptive eligibility coverage by the Hospital, the Qualified Hospital will notify individuals in writing and orally if appropriate, of the non- appealable outcome of the presumptive eligibility determination.
For individuals found presumptively eligible for MassHealth, the notice will explain the duration of their presumptive eligibility; the services available to them and how to access them; and information on how to submit an application for continued coverage and the importance of doing so. If they are not found presumptively eligible, the notice will inform them of the decision; provide a reason for the determination; and advise them how to submit the full MassHealth Application. EOHHS will provide notice language for the Qualified Hospitals to use.
If a Qualified Hospital does not follow state or federal laws, regulations, policies and procedures, or is not successful in helping individuals to submit full MassHealth Applications in accordance with the established State-developed Performance Standards, EOHHS will require the Qualified Hospital to participate in additional training or other reasonable corrective action measures as appropriate.
After any corrective action measures have been implemented, if a Qualified Hospital fails to comply with any corrective action plan or one or more established State-developed Performance Standards, the Contract may be suspended for a period of time or permanently terminated.
If the Hospital is disqualified from making presumptive eligibility determinations, such disqualification will not necessarily limit the Hospital from participating in MassHealth or any agreements other than this one between the Hospital and EOHHS.
A Hospital’s application to elect to make presumptive eligibility determinations may be rejected if it fails to meet any one of the following criteria:
A. Proper Submission
Each Hospital must submit a complete application and one (1) copy in accordance with these instructions to the designated address in this RFA. (See Section IX of this RFA.)
B. Acceptance of Agreement
Appendix A, the Hospital-Determined Presumptive Eligibility Contract, is the Contract that will be awarded pursuant to this RFA. The applicant must accept the provisions of Appendix A without revision by signing the last page of Appendix A.

C. Certification
The Hospital must complete Appendix B and certify that all information and documentation
required to be on file with MassHealth is complete, current and correct.
D. Executive Order 504

The provisions shall be enforced through the contracting agency and the Operational Services Division. Any breach shall be regarded as a material breach of the contract that may subject the Applicant to appropriate sanctions.
Accordingly, the MassHealth Hospital-Determined Presumptive Eligibility Contract contained in Appendix A requires that Hospitals complete and return the Executive Order 504 Certification contained in Appendix C.

This transition period is tentatively scheduled for February 28, 2014 – March 23, 2014. During the transition period any information that EHS would normally post to Comm-PASS will be posted to the following website: http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/comm-pass.
Applicants are cautioned to check this site regularly, as this will be the sole method used for notification of changes to open solicitations and new solicitations during the transition
period. Applicants may also contact the issuer identified in this RFA to confirm that they have the most recent documents necessary to respond. After the transition period, all information about this RFA can be found on COMMBUYS by searching the Alternate ID field for the RFA document number 14CBEHSHPERFA.
All applicants responding to this RFA agree that: (1) they will maintain an active Comm-PASS account until such time as the Commonwealth’s new eProcurement system, COMMBUYS, replaces the Comm-PASS system; (2) they will maintain an active vendor account in COMMBUYS; (3) they will, if directed to do so by the procuring entity, activate and maintain a contract and technically compliant catalog in COMMBUYS; (4) they will comply with all requests by the procuring entity to utilize COMMBUYS for the purposes of conducting all aspects of purchasing and invoicing with the Commonwealth, as added functionality for the COMMBUYS system is activated; (5) Applicant understands and acknowledges that all references to the Comm-PASS website or related requirements throughout this RFA shall be superseded by comparable requirements pertaining to the COMMBUYS website upon replacement of the Comm-PASS system; and (6) in the event the Commonwealth adopts an alternate eProcurement system, successful Applicants will be required to utilize such system, as directed by the procuring entity.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein
A. The Qualified Hospital agrees:

6. Privacy and Security:
a. In performing their functions hereunder, the Qualified Hospital and/or its Certified Application Counselors may create, modify, access or receive personal information about an identifiable individual that is protected under federal or state confidentiality laws or regulations including, without limitation, “personal data,” as defined in the Massachusetts Fair Information Practices Act (M.G.L. c. 66A) (“FIPA”), personally identifiable information,” as defined in 45 CFR § 155.260 and “protected health information,” as defined in 45 C.F.R. § 160.103 (any such information, “PI”). If determined necessary by EOHHS, CACs may be required to obtain consent from the individual to the extent necessary to comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations. The Qualified Hospital and its Certified Application Counselors are required by law to protect the privacy and security of such PI. The Qualified Hospital hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall comply with, and shall ensure that its Certified Application Counselors comply with, all applicable state and federal laws and regulations concerning the confidentiality and security of PI (including, without limitation, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (42 U.S.C. §§ 1320d-1320d-8) and its implementing regulations (45 CFR. Parts 160, 162 and 164) and Section 1902(a)(7) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(7)) and the laws and regulations promulgated thereunder (42 CFR Part 431, Subpart F, M.G.L. c. 118E, § 49 and 130 CMR §§ 501 and 515))and any additional requirements set forth in this agreement. All PI that the Qualified Hospital or a Certified Application Counselor creates, modifies, accesses or receives in connection with performing their functions hereunder is the exclusive property of EOHHS. EOHHS reserves all of its rights to exercise complete control over the access, use, disclosure, and disposition of such PI. The Qualified Hospital agrees to certify to EOHHS, upon request, that in its use of such PI it is in compliance with this Agreement. The Qualified Hospital shall limit access to PI obtained from any source in connection with the performance of this Agreement to those employees, contractors, and agents that need such information in furtherance of the purposes for which EOHHS has entered into this Agreement, and shall ensure that such information is used only for such purposes and only as permitted by appropriate applicant consent documented in the manner directed by EOHHS or required under the CAC Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Qualified Hospital acknowledges and agrees that in performing its functions hereunder, the Qualified Hospital and its Certified Application Counselors may become “Holders” of “Personal Data” as those terms are defined in FIPA. To the extent the Qualified Hospital becomes a Holder of Personal Data or otherwise receives or accesses Personal Data, the Qualified Hospital acknowledges that it is subject to, and agrees to comply with and to ensure that its Certified Application Counselors comply with, FIPA.
b. The Qualified Hospital shall use appropriate safeguards as required by all applicable privacy and security rules and regulations to prevent the use or disclosure of PI other than as permitted or required under this Agreement. The Qualified Hospital shall at all times comply with all Commonwealth privacy, security and information technology resource policies, processes and mechanisms established for access to such PI. The Qualified Hospital agrees that it has in place the same or more stringent privacy and security standards with respect to PI as EOHHS. Upon EOHHS’s request, the Qualified Hospital shall permit representatives of EOHHS access to the premises where PI is maintained, created, used, or disclosed for the purpose of inspecting privacy and security arrangements.
c. The Qualified Hospital will immediately notify EOHHS upon becoming aware of any suspected and/or confirmed: (i) use or disclosure of PI not permitted under this Agreement, (ii) breach of security (as defined in M.G.L. c. 93H, §1(a)) involving PI (ii) or suspected or confirmed security incident. For purposes of this paragraph, a “security incident” means the act of violating an explicit or implied security policy, which includes attempts (whether or not successful) to gain unauthorized access to a system or its data (including PI), unwanted disruption or denial of service, the unauthorized use of a system for the processing or storage of data (including PI); and changes to system hardware, firmware, or software characteristics without the owner's knowledge, instruction, or consent. Security incidents include but are not limited to the loss of data (including PI) through theft or device misplacement, loss or misplacement of hardcopy documents, and misrouting of mail. The Qualified Hospital shall immediately attempt to retrieve PI disclosed or made accessible in violation of this Agreement; take other appropriate actions to mitigate known harmful consequences of the non-permitted use or disclosure; and take such other reasonable and appropriate mitigation actions as may be requested by EOHHS. The Qualified Hospital shall report to EOHHS, both orally and in writing, the nature of the non- permitted use, disclosure, breach of security or security incident, the harmful effects known to the Qualified Hospital, all actions it has taken or plans to take in accord with this paragraph, and the results of all mitigation actions already taken by it under this paragraph. Any actions to mitigate harmful effects of a non-permitted use or disclosure, breach of security or security incident by the Qualified Hospital on its own initiative or pursuant to the request of EOHHS under this paragraph shall not relieve the Qualified Hospital of its obligations to report such violations as set forth in this Agreement or under applicable law.
B. EOHHS agrees:
1. That it will provide HPE Application training, the HPE Application, and the notices to Qualified Hospitals.
2. That it will monitor Hospitals’ performance on the following two metrics:
a. The percentage of individuals determined presumptively eligible who then fill out a complete MassHealth application within the presumptive eligibility period. Hospitals are expected to have 75% or more of the individuals that are determined presumptively eligible complete MassHealth application for full coverage by the end of the presumptive eligibility period.
b. The percentage of presumptively eligible individuals who fill out a complete MassHealth application, and are found eligible for MassHealth coverage, before the end of the presumptive eligibility period. In the initial phase of implementation, EOHHS will monitor all participating Hospitals to assess the average rate of success and will formulate a measure based on this assessment. EOHHS will inform Qualified Hospitals of the metric to be employed prospectively for all participating Hospitals for measuring compliance with full MassHealth enrollment prior to the end of the presumptive eligibility period, as well as the timelines for compliance with that standard.
3. That it will notify the Hospital in writing of any re-training or other corrective action plans if the Qualified Hospital does not comply with State-developed Performance Standards.
C. The Qualified Hospital and EOHHS mutually agree:
1. Any actions arising out of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Massachusetts and shall be brought and maintained in a state or federal court in Massachusetts which shall have exclusive jurisdiction thereof.
2. It is specifically agreed between the parties that failure of any of the parties to insist upon compliance of any provisions herein at any time shall not waive such compliance with such provision at any other time. No waiver by any party of any default or breach hereunder by the other shall constitute a waiver of any subsequent default or breach.
3. The parties do not intend by this Agreement to create any enforceable rights in debtors, third parties or other similarly situated persons. Any benefits flowing to debtors, third parties or others as a result of this Agreement are merely incidental, and all rights, obligations, benefits and duties are enforceable solely by the parties hereto.
4. This Agreement taken together with the laws, waivers, regulations, rules, provider bulletins, and other written statements of policy that govern the MassHealth program embodies the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter. No statement, representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement of any kind not set forth in this Agreement will affect, or be used to interpret, change, or restrict the express terms and provisions of this Agreement. This Agreement is in addition to, and not in place of, other agreements that the Qualified Hospital has entered into with EOHHS or its agencies.
5. The following attachments will be deemed to be part of this Agreement:
a. The MassHealth Hospital-Determined Presumptive Eligibility RFA dated March 21, 2014, and all appendices and attachments thereto;
b. All information and documentation submitted by the Qualified Hospital in response to the MassHealth Hospital Determined Presumptive Eligibility RFA; and
c. The Provider application(s) and supporting documentation of the above-named Qualified Hospital, which is required to be on file with MassHealth and supporting documentation and any changes or amendments thereto accepted and agreed to by EOHHS.

Section I. Section II. Section III. Section IV. Section V. Section VI. Section VII. Section VIII. Section IX. Section X.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) is issuing this Request for Applications (RFA) to solicit applications from Hospitals that elect to perform presumptive eligibility determinations for certain individuals that, on the basis of preliminary information, appear to be eligible for MassHealth coverage.
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) allows Hospitals to make presumptive eligibility determinations for temporary coverage using self-attested information from certain individuals who appear to be eligible for Medicaid coverage.
With this RFA, MassHealth seeks applications from Hospitals that wish to make presumptive eligibility determinations under the ACA. Upon receipt of applications to this RFA, EOHHS shall evaluate each submission based on the criteria set forth in this RFA. Upon EOHHS’ approval of a Hospital’s application, the Hospital and the EOHHS shall execute a MassHealth Hospital- Determined Presumptive Eligibility Contract. The non-financial Contract will remain valid until either party terminates the Contract or the Hospital is disqualified from making presumptive eligibility determinations, whichever occurs first. EOHHS reserves the right to terminate this agreement immediately without notice if it determines that any material term of the Contract has been violated.
The following terms appearing capitalized throughout this RFA and its appendices shall be defined as follows, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
Affordable Care Act (ACA) — the informal term for the two federal statutes known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Pub. L. No. 111–152, of 2010.
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) — the federal agency under the Department of Health and Human Services that is responsible for administering the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority (Connector or Exchange) — the independent public entity established by M.G.L. chapter 176Q, section 2, the purpose of which is to facilitate the availability, choice and adoption of private health insurance plans to eligible individuals and groups.
Contract (also MassHealth Hospital-Determined Presumptive Eligibility Contract or Agreement) — the non-financial agreement executed between each selected Hospital and EOHHS, which is contained in Appendix A attached hereto, and incorporates all of the provisions of this RFA.
Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) — the single state agency that is responsible for the administration of the MassHealth Program, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 118E and Titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act and other applicable laws and waivers.
Health Insurance Exchange (HIX)/Integrated Eligibility System (IES) — a web-based Health Insurance Exchange (HIX)/Integrated Eligibility System (IES) developed for Massachusetts’ healthcare programs to streamline eligibility determinations through real-time data matching with state and federal databases.
Hospital — any Hospital, including Satellite Clinics, that participates as a MassHealth provider pursuant to the terms of the MassHealth applicable Hospital RFA and corresponding regulations; or any Hospital owned and operated by the Commonwealth; or any out-of-state Hospital that participates in MassHealth pursuant to applicable MassHealth regulations (see, 130 CMR 415.000 et seq; 130 CMR 410.000 et seq; 130 CMR 425.000 et seq; 130 CMR 434.000 et seq; and 130 CMR 435.000 et seq.)

MassHealth Application — a request for health benefits that is received by the MassHealth agency and includes all required information and a signature by the applicant or his or her authorized representative. The application may be submitted at www.MAHealthConnector.org, or the applicant may complete a paper application, complete a telephone application, or apply in person at a MassHealth Enrollment Center (MEC).
Member — a person determined by EOHHS, or presumptively determined by a Hospital, to be eligible for medical assistance under the MassHealth program.

Provider — an individual or entity that has a written contract with EOHHS to provide medical goods or services to Members.
Qualified Hospital (or Contractor) — a Hospital that submits a satisfactory application in response to this RFA and enters into a MassHealth Hospital-Determined Presumptive Eligibility Contract with EOHHS to make MassHealth presumptive eligibility determinations pursuant to the ACA, 42 CFR 435.1110 and governing state regulations, policies and procedures.
Satellite Clinic — a facility that operates under a Hospital’s license, is subject to the fiscal, administrative, and clinical management of the Hospital, provides services to Members solely on an outpatient basis, is not located at the same site as the Hospital’s inpatient facility, and demonstrates to EOHHS’ satisfaction that it has CMS provider-based status in accordance with 42 CFR 413.65.
State-developed Performance Standards –metrics developed by EOHHS regarding submission of applications for full MassHealth benefits and the outcome of such applications and other measures designed to evaluate Hospitals’ presumptive eligibility performance as they may be updated from time to time.
Hospitals must be “Qualified Hospitals” to perform presumptive eligibility determinations. In order to be considered qualified, a Hospital must:
1. Use only properly trained CACs on-site at a Hospital location to assist Hospitals in making presumptive eligibility determinations.
2. Notify EOHHS of its election to make presumptive eligibility determinations in accordance with EOHHS policy and guidelines;
3. Agree to make presumptive eligibility determinations in accordance with federal and state statutes, regulations, policies and procedures, including training requirements and, if a Hospital uses third party contractors, the requirement in 42 CFR 435.1102(b)(2)(vi) that a Hospital cannot “delegate the authority to determine presumptive eligibility to another entity”;
4. Agree to have CACs available to assist individuals to complete and submit a full MassHealth Application as described in 130 CMR 502.001 in accordance with all applicable requirements; and
5. Not be disqualified by EOHHS from making presumptive eligibility determinations.
A Hospital that seeks to participate but does not meet all of the above requirements will not be approved to make presumptive eligibility determinations.
In determining whether a Hospital satisfies the requirements set forth in Section III, EOHHS may evaluate, pursuant to an on-site audit or otherwise, a number of factors including, but not limited to, State-developed Performance Standards.
A Hospital must notify EOHHS of its election to make presumptive eligibility determinations by submitting an Application in response to this RFA. The enrollment process will remain open under this RFA. Hospitals must return a signed agreement and participate in any training necessary prior to making presumptive eligibility determinations.
􏰀􏰁􏰂􏰃􏰄􏰅􏰆􏰇􏰕􏰉 􏰗􏰅􏰘􏰙􏰔􏰄􏰓􏰆􏰂􏰁
Prior to performing any presumptive eligibility determinations, Hospitals that elect to perform presumptive eligibility determinations and their CACs will be required to participate in training sessions that are administered by EOHHS. Hospitals are required to maintain records of the names of CACs and their CAC training status as set forth in the Contract. CACs will use the HPE Application and presumptive eligibility notices provided by EOHHS. CACs will be required to offer assistance to individuals who are determined presumptively eligible in completing a full MassHealth Application for coverage.
EOHHS will monitor and track each Qualified Hospital’s implementation of presumptive eligibility determinations using State-developed Performance Standards regarding submission of applications for full MassHealth benefits and the outcome of such applications. The Qualified Hospital will provide the data specified by EOHHS on performance indicators to assist EOHHS in monitoring compliance with the performance standards. The data will be submitted in accordance with EOHHS directions and timeframes.
MassHealth will monitor two measures to ensure that Hospitals are making presumptive eligibility determinations in a judicious manner. The details of performance measurement are provided in the contract. EOHHS will work with Hospitals that do not meet the standards to provide additional training, and, if necessary, develop and implement corrective action plans.
When conducting presumptive eligibility determinations, the Qualified Hospital will rely on information provided by applicants. It will not require or request any documentation or verification of the information, nor will it require any information that is not needed for a presumptive eligibility determination.
The Qualified Hospital will use a simplified measure of an individual’s household and income to make presumptive eligibility determinations. It will require applicants to attest to their citizenship or immigration status and residency when completing the HPE Application.
Hospitals may make presumptive eligibility determinations for:
• Children aged 0-18 and young adults aged 19-20 eligible for MassHealth Standard
• Pregnant women eligible for MassHealth Standard
• Former foster care youth up to age 26 eligible for MassHealth Standard
• Adults aged 21-64 eligible for MassHealth CarePlus
• Parents or other caretaker relatives eligible for MassHealth Standard
• Uninsured individuals with breast or cervical cancer eligible for MassHealth Standard
• HIV positive individuals eligible for MassHealth Standard or HIV-Family Assistance
• Children who are non-qualified permanent residents under color of law (PRUCOLs) eligible for MassHealth Family Assistance
Individuals found presumptively eligible will receive the MassHealth coverage for which they appear eligible (i.e., MassHealth Standard, MassHealth CarePlus, or MassHealth Family Assistance). No presumptive eligibility is offered for other MassHealth coverage including, but not limited to, MassHealth Limited and Health Safety Net.
Once an individual is approved or denied presumptive eligibility coverage by the Hospital, the Qualified Hospital will notify individuals in writing and orally if appropriate, of the non- appealable outcome of the presumptive eligibility determination.
For individuals found presumptively eligible for MassHealth, the notice will explain the duration of their presumptive eligibility; the services available to them and how to access them; and information on how to submit an application for continued coverage and the importance of doing so. If they are not found presumptively eligible, the notice will inform them of the decision; provide a reason for the determination; and advise them how to submit the full MassHealth Application. EOHHS will provide notice language for the Qualified Hospitals to use.􏰆
If a Qualified Hospital does not follow state or federal laws, regulations, policies and procedures, or is not successful in helping individuals to submit full MassHealth Applications in accordance with the established State-developed Performance Standards, EOHHS will require the Qualified Hospital to participate in additional training or other reasonable corrective action measures as appropriate.
After any corrective action measures have been implemented, if a Qualified Hospital fails to comply with any corrective action plan or one or more established State-developed Performance Standards, the Contract may be suspended for a period of time or permanently terminated.
If the Hospital is disqualified from making presumptive eligibility determinations, such disqualification will not necessarily limit the Hospital from participating in MassHealth or any agreements other than this one between the Hospital and EOHHS.􏰇􏰈􏰆􏰏􏰃􏰊􏰌􏰂􏰃􏰄􏰅􏰆􏰏
A Hospital’s application to elect to make presumptive eligibility determinations may be rejected if it fails to meet any one of the following criteria:
A. Proper Submission
Each Hospital must submit a complete application and one (1) copy in accordance with these instructions to the designated address in this RFA. (See Section IX of this RFA.)
B. Acceptance of Agreement
Appendix A, the Hospital-Determined Presumptive Eligibility Contract, is the Contract that will be awarded pursuant to this RFA. The applicant must accept the provisions of Appendix A without revision by signing the last page of Appendix A.

C. Certification
The Hospital must complete Appendix B and certify that all information and documentation
required to be on file with MassHealth is complete, current and correct.
D. Executive Order 504
All contracts entered into by state agencies after January 1, 2009 must contain provisions requiring applicants to certify that they have read EXECUTIVE ORDER 504, that they have reviewed and will comply with all information, security programs, plans, guidelines, standards and policies that apply to the work they will be performing for their contracting agency, that they will communicate these provisions to and enforce them against their subcontractors, and that they will implement and maintain any other reasonable and appropriate security procedures and practices necessary to protect personal information to which they are given access as part of the contract from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, disclosure or loss. The provisions shall be enforced through the contracting agency and the Operational Services Division. Any breach shall be regarded as a material breach of the contract that may subject the Applicant to appropriate sanctions.
Accordingly, the MassHealth Hospital-Determined Presumptive Eligibility Contract contained in Appendix A requires that Hospitals complete and return the Executive Order 504 Certification contained in Appendix C.
