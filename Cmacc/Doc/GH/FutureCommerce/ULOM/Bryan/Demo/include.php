There are a couple of demonstrations here.  The first five steps (01 - 05) are part of a flow from parties first making contact - (friending or exchanging business cards).  Then they agree some framework stuff, nothing serious, just getting on the same page.  Then an actual agreement. Start at 05 and follow back. <br> 93 presents this kind of thing from an opposite direction, and presents a <i>tree of all contract</i> approach.  You start with 93 and peel back.  Each page is an addition to a prior page, presented as the last link at the bottom of the page.  So you are tracing the path from the agreement of the parties along the branches of the (legal and social) tree that they chose to alight on. The branches connect to a trunk of "agreement."
