 The CLIENT NAME Revocable TrustThis indenture of trust is made this ___ day of _______________, 2016, by CLIENT NAME as Donor (the “Donor”), and Trustee (the “Trustee” or the “Trustees”).The Donor and the Trustee agree as follows:ARTICLE I. NAME OF TRUST. This trust shall be known as “THE CLIENT NAME REVOCABLE TRUST.”ARTICLE II. AMENDMENTS; REVOCATION. The Donor shall have the right to amend or revoke this instrument in any respect as often as desired, in whole or in part, at which time the property then held in trust, or the portion of it to which any amendment or revocation applies, shall be transferred in accordance with the directions of the Donor. To be given effect, such amendments or revocations must be delivered to the Trustees in writing. ARTICLE III. TRUST PROPERTY. The Trustees agree with the Donor that they will hold all property now or later transferred by any person to them as Trustees in accordance with the terms and provisions of this indenture.ARTICLE IV. TERM. The trust shall terminate when the Donor is not living and the youngest child of the Donor has reached the age of twenty-five (25), unless unusual circumstances exist under Article VII, Section C, or all the trust property has been previously distributed.ARTICLE V. DISPOSITIONS OF TRUST PROPERTY. Section A. Disposition During Donor’s Lifetime. While the Donor is living, the Trustees shall pay to the Donor so much of the income and principal of the trust (including the whole thereof), as the Donor shall, from time to time, request. In the absence of any such request, the Trustees may pay to or apply for the benefit of the Donor or any beneficiary hereunder, any part or all of the net income and principal as the Trustees shall in their discretion deem advisable, with full power to accumulate any income not so paid or applied and to hold the same for future use or to add the same in whole or in part to principal. If, in the opinion of the Trustees, the Donor shall be incapable, by reason of absence, illness or any other cause, of managing his own affairs, the Trustees may, without the Donor’s consent, pay so much of the net income and principal to or for the benefit of the Donor or any beneficiary hereunder in any manner as the Trustees, in their full discretion, shall deem advisable.The Trustees may rely upon the certificate of an attending physician as to the Donor’s incapacity. Section B. Dispositions Upon the Death of the Donor. Upon the death of the Donor, remaining trust property shall be held and or distributed under this Article V, Section B. Trust property shall be divided into separate, equal, sub-trust shares, one for each of the Donor’s then-living children. One of these sub-trust shares shall be set aside to be managed for the benefit of the Donor’s son SON NAME. Such share shall include any real property or interest in real property of the Donor located at ADDRESS, whether such property is owned outright or through another entity in which the Donor has an interest. If including such property while still maintaining sub-trust shares of equal value would cause undue difficulty, is not possible, or is not (in the Trustee’s complete discretion) in the beneficiaries’ best interest, such property may be liquidated in order to ensure equal shares. Remaining trust shares shall be paid to or held for the benefit of the Donor’s wife WIFE NAME, except that if at the time of the Donor’s death, the Donor and WIFE NAME are no longer married to each other, or if any of the following situations apply, then WIFE NAME shall be treated as having predeceased: (1) either WIFE or the Donor have filed and served (a) a complaint or action for annulment, divorce or dissolution of the marriage; (b) a complaint or action for separate support or legal separation; (c) a complaint for division of assets pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, Section 34 or any other equitable property division statute of any jurisdiction; or (d) an action at law or in equity seeking support or alimony from the other based upon their relationship/cohabitation and/or marriage, whether pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, Section 34 or any other support statute of any jurisdiction; or (2) either WIFE or the Donor have sought a judicial determination and a judicial division of community property interest in any jurisdiction.If WIFE NAME has predeceased, said trust shares shall be paid to or held for the benefit of the Donor’s other then-living children (besides SON NAME whose share is set out above).If a child of the Donor has predeceased, the share such deceased child would have received had he or she survived the Donor shall instead be paid to or held for the benefit of the issue of the deceased child by right of representation. If the deceased child has died without issue, the share the deceased child would have received had he or she survived the Donor shall be paid to or held for the benefit of the surviving children of the Donor or to their issue by right of representation. If there is no issue of the Donor then living, remaining trust property shall be disposed of under Article VI.(a) Share for a Beneficiary Under the Age of Twenty-five (25). A share for a beneficiary under the age of twenty-five (25) shall continue to be held hereunder until he or she reaches such age. During administration, the Trustees may pay to or for the benefit of such beneficiary so much of the income and principal of the trust (including the whole thereof), as the Trustees shall deem advisable in their full discretion, with full power to accumulate any income not so paid or applied and to hold the same for future use or to add the same in whole or in part to principal.  Such payment or application shall be made at such times and in such proportions as the Trustees in their discretion shall determine. (b) Share for a Beneficiary Age Twenty-five (25) or Older. If a beneficiary has reached the age of twenty-five (25), that beneficiary shall receive his or her share outright and free of trust unless the terms of Article VII, Section C shall apply. Trustees may, in their complete discretion (while they are not compelled to), take prior distributions of income and or principal into account in determining a beneficiary’s share either during trust administration and or in outright distribution.During trust administration, the Trustees may, out of the net income and or principal, from time to time pay such amount or amounts as the Trustee shall determine, to or for the benefit of such beneficiaries as the Trustees deem necessary for their continued health, education, maintenance and or support in their accustomed standard of living.Section C.  Disposition Upon Beneficiary’s Death During Trust Administration. If a beneficiary shall die during trust administration, the Trustees shall distribute then remaining trust property as if that beneficiary predeceased under Article V, Section B above. ARTICLE VI. ULTIMATE DISPOSITION. Whenever property is directed to be distributed under this Article, such property shall be paid to the persons who would be entitled to receive the Donor’s property under the laws of Massachusetts then in force and in the proportions prescribed by such laws as if the Donor had then died intestate and unmarried as a resident of Massachusetts.ARTICLE VII. ADDITIONAL DISPOSITIVE PROVISIONS. Section A. Principal Distribution. Each power granted to the Trustees to distribute principal is expressly intended to authorize the Trustees to distribute the entire principal of the trust.Section B. Payments of Debts and Taxes. The Trustees may pay to the legal representative of the Donor’s estate, as an expense of administration, such sum or sums as the legal representative may certify to be due and payable from the estates of the Donor for debts, funeral expenses, administration expenses and legacies (other than residuary) under the will of the Donor. The Trustees are directed to pay any amounts certified by the legal representative of the Donor’s estate as due for state or federal estate taxes (including penalties on any death taxes). The certification of the legal representative as to the amount of such debts, funeral expenses, taxes, administration expenses and legacies shall be sufficient authority to the Trustees to pay the same, and the Trustees’ judgment as to such payments shall be binding and conclusive upon all parties. If no petition has been filed for the appointment of a legal representative within ninety (90) days after the death of the Donor, the Trustees may pay any of the Donor’s debts, funeral expenses, taxes, administration expenses and legacies that the Trustees in their absolute discretion deem advisable to pay. To the extent possible, no payment under this Section shall be made from any item of property if making a payment from that property would subject it to state or federal estate taxes which would otherwise not be payable.  Section C. Unusual Circumstances.  If the terms of this instrument direct a distribution to a beneficiary outright and free of trust, but the Trustees deem it unwise to distribute that beneficiary’s share outright and free of trust by reason of unusual circumstances (as defined herein), the Trustees shall have the right (regardless of beneficiary’s age) to retain that beneficiary’s share until such time as the special circumstance shall cease to exist in the full discretion of the Trustees.  During this time, trust property held for such beneficiary may be paid to, or applied for the benefit of such beneficiary, so much of the net income and the principal hereof as the Trustees in their full discretion shall deem advisable.Such unusual circumstances shall include (but are not limited to) the physical or emotional disability or emotional instability of such beneficiary, the involvement of such beneficiary in the use of drugs, alcohol or other similar addictive substances, the involvement of the beneficiary as a defendant in a serious litigation or bankruptcy, the involvement of the beneficiary in marital difficulties, the involvement of the beneficiary in a cult or similar type of organization, the beneficiary being a resident of a country that will deprive him/her of the enjoyment of the funds and/or the beneficiary being on active military duty in a war zone. The decision of the Trustees to retain such beneficiary’s income and or principal in trust shall be final and binding upon all parties and such share shall continue to be held in trust as aforesaid until such beneficiary dies or until the Trustees determine that such unusual circumstances no longer exist, whichever shall first occur.  ARTICLE VIII. DEFINITIONS. The following definitions shall be applied in interpreting this indenture:1. The word “issue” shall mean direct descendants in the first, second or any other degree of kindred to the person designated, and shall be construed as singular or plural in number, as shall be appropriate to the context.2. The Donor has three (3) children: his sons SON NAME, OTHER NAME, and THIRD NAME.3.	In determining whether any person is the “issue” or “ancestor” of a designated person, it shall be assumed that decrees of divorce rendered by a court of record, wherever located, are valid, and persons adopted while minors according to law shall be deemed to be the lawful blood descendants of the adopting parents and of the adopting parents’ ancestors.4.	A distribution “by right of representation” among the living issue of a specified person shall mean a division at the designated time and into as many equal shares as are required to provide one such share for each child of the specified person living at such time and one such share for each deceased child of the specified person who left issue living at such time, with the share of a deceased child further divided into equal shares in the same manner and a like division at each level of descent until all the property to be distributed has been allocated among the living issue of the specified person.5.	The term “trust property,” unless otherwise characterized or defined for a specific purpose, shall mean the remaining balance, from time to time, of all of the property held in trust under this instrument, wherever such property may be situated, whether it is real, personal or mixed, and regardless of whether such balance includes property which was originally trust principal or the proceeds of original trust principal.6.	Where necessary for the proper meaning to be given to any term used in this indenture, words denoting one gender shall include the other genders, the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular.7.   “Trustees” shall mean the trustee or trustees then serving under this instrument.ARTICLE IX.

to determine whether any discounts shall be accumulated; and to determine whether to add to principal any portion of dividends received on wasting investments and interest received on bonds purchased at a premium;6.	to vote, in person or by general or limited proxy, or to refrain from voting, any shares of stock held in the trust;7.	to borrow money, with or without security, for any purpose of the trust, on such terms as the Trustees shall deem appropriate, and to mortgage or pledge property of the trust for the purpose of securing any loan;8.	to lend funds to the legal representative of the Donor’s estate on such terms as the Trustees shall deem appropriate, and to purchase assets from the Donor’s estate at such prices as the Trustees shall agree to;9.	to lend money to any beneficiary who at the time of the loan is entitled or eligible to receive distributions of income or principal from the trust, on such terms and at such rate of interest (or without interest) as the Trustees shall deem appropriate;10.	to hold any asset of the trust in bearer form or in the name of a nominee, without any indication of fiduciary capacity;

GENERAL PROVISIONS. The following provisions shall apply to each trust established by this indenture:1.	Life Insurance. As to any policies of insurance on the life of the Donor which are payable to the Trustees as beneficiary but are not owned by them:(a) 	during the life of the Donor the Trustees shall not be entitled to receive any dividends or other payments accruing on the policies or to exercise any benefits, options or privileges on them, these rights being reserved by the Donor, and the Trustees shall not be under any duty to pay premiums, dues, assessments or other charges which are or may become due or payable on these policies; and(b) 	after the death of the Donor the Trustees shall use their best efforts to collect all amounts payable to them as Trustees. The Trustees shall have no obligation to enforce payment of the policies until they have been indemnified to their satisfaction.2.	Spendthrift Clause. No beneficiary may sell, pledge or otherwise transfer any part of his or her interest in this trust (except to the Trustees as security for a loan or advance from the trust), and the Trustees shall not recognize any such other transfer attempted. The interest of each beneficiary in this trust shall not be subject to being taken by his or her creditors (other than the Trustees in their capacity as Trustees of the trust) by any process whatever.3.	Limitation on Trustees’ Liability. No Trustee shall be held personally liable by reason of any action taken, suffered or omitted in good faith.4.	Trustees’ Bonds. No bond or surety shall be required of any original or successor Trustee.5.	Liability for Actions of Prior Trustees. No Trustee shall be responsible for the acts or omissions of another Trustee. Each additional or successor Trustee shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of any Trustee prior to the time he or she became a Trustee.6.	Powers of Successor Trustees. The incumbent Trustees shall have all of the title, powers and discretion granted to the original Trustees, without court order or act of transfer.7.	Rights and Obligations of Third Parties. If any Trustee discloses fiduciary capacity in dealing with any person, then that person shall have no claim against the Trustees as individuals, but only against the trust property. Anyone may rely on any statements of facts certified to by any Trustee. Whenever the Trustees act pursuant to authority contained in this indenture or under law, third parties may rely on such acts without inquiry. No one dealing with the Trustees need see to the application of any money paid or property transferred to or upon the order of any Trustee.8.	Survivorship of Beneficiaries. If any beneficiary shall die simultaneously or under such circumstances that the order of death with respect to the Donor cannot be established, or if such beneficiary is not living thirty (30) days after the date on which any distribution or principal conditioned on the beneficiary’s survival to that date is required, such beneficiary shall not be deemed to have survived the Donor or to have been living on the date specified for the distribution. 9. Successor Trustees, Resignation, Limitation.  Upon the Donor’s death, the Donor’s wife WIFE NAME shall serve as Trustee. If she is unavailable or unwilling to serve as Trustee, or if at the time of the Donor’s death he and WIFE are no longer married to each other, or if any of the following situations apply,  the Donor’s brother BROTHER NAME shall serve as successor Trustee: (1) either WIFE or the Donor have filed and served (a) a complaint or action for annulment, divorce or dissolution of the marriage; (b) a complaint or action for separate support or legal separation; (c) a complaint for division of assets pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, Section 34 or any other equitable property division statute of any jurisdiction; or (d) an action at law or in equity seeking support or alimony from the other based upon their relationship/cohabitation and/or marriage, whether pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, Section 34 or any other support statute of any jurisdiction; or (2) either WIFE or the Donor have sought a judicial determination and a judicial division of community property interest in any jurisdiction.Vacancies in the office of Trustee shall be filled by an appointment made by the Donor, if available. Further vacancies shall be filled by appointment of a resigning Trustee, or if none, by agreement of a majority in number of the beneficiaries who are then-living and legally competent and the personal or legal guardian, if any, of any beneficiary not then legally competent. Otherwise, vacancies shall be filled by a nomination made to the probate court where one of the Donor’s estate was or would be administered.	Any Trustee may resign at any time by written instrument delivered to any person authorized to appoint a successor Trustee. A successor Trustee shall make written acceptance of office.	The Donor may remove a Trustee at any time without cause.10.	Governing Law. The validity and effect of this instrument and the administration of the trusts created by it shall be determined by the laws of Massachusetts.11.	Trustees’ Accounts. The Trustees may, and upon request shall, render periodic accounts with respect to the trusts to the person or persons then entitled or eligible to receive the income of the trust in question who are of full age and competent and to the legal representatives, if any, then acting for those who are not, except that no accounts shall be required of the Trustees for the period of the Donor’s lifetime unless requested by the Donor or the Donor’s legal representative. Such income beneficiary (including the Donor) or beneficiaries (and such legal representatives, if any, then acting) shall have the full power and authority to assent in writing to and settle finally any such account and, on the basis of such assent, to release the Trustees from all liability for their acts and omissions as Trustees. Any such assent shall, as to all matters or transactions stated in such account or shown by it, be binding upon all persons who are then or who may thereafter become interested in the income or principal of the trust, even if any of such persons are then under legal disability, unknown or not yet in being. The failure of any such income beneficiary to object in writing to any such account for ninety (90) days after an account has been mailed to him or her shall be deemed an assent and shall be binding and conclusive to the same extent as the written approval provided for above. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to give the person or persons to whom such accounts are rendered any power or right to enlarge or shift the beneficial interest of any beneficiary.12.	Form and Filing. All trust amendments and revocations, resignations of Trustees, decisions to terminate and appointments and acceptances of successor Trustees shall be made by written instrument, signed, and filed with the records of the trust during the lifetime of the person executing such instrument. In addition, trust amendments and revocations shall be acknowledged.13.	Compensation of Trustee. Any individual Trustee serving hereunder shall be entitled to be paid a reasonable fee from the trust, based on the amount of time expended by such Trustee in carrying out his/her duties hereunder. Any corporate Trustee shall be entitled to be paid a fee based upon its fee schedule as it may publish from time to time. 14. Naming Separate Trust Shares for Convenience. Because of the fact that there may exist several separate trust shares under this indenture, the Trustees may by a writing assign a name to any particular trust share in a manner that the Trustees may deem appropriate to more conveniently identify such trust share. Any such assigned name may be utilized by the Trustees both internally for administrative purposes and with respect to the Trustees’ dealings with third parties, such as the Internal Revenue Service, brokers, transfer agents, providers of financial and investment services, etc., and any particular trust share given an assigned name may own assets, both real and personal, tangible or intangible, under such assigned name. 15.	Copies. A copy of this instrument and of the writings, if any, attached to it, certified by a notary public, or a corrected copy of this instrument purporting to incorporate all textual amendments to date and certified by a notary public, may be relied on by any person as fully as the original documents themselves; and any certificate by anyone whom such original documents or such certified copies indicate to be a Trustee shall be evidence of the facts therein stated, including statements as to the appointment and status as Trustee of the person executing the certificate, and any person dealing with such apparent Trustee may rely on any such certificate dated not more than three months before presentation.16.	Generation-Skipping Tax. Notwithstanding any other provision of this instrument, if a generation-skipping trust exemption shall apply to part but not all of the property of any trust established under this instrument, such trust shall be divided into two parts, one of which parts will be the exempt portion and the other of which will be the nonexempt portion, and the Trustees shall hold and dispose of each such part as a separate trust.17. 	Rule Against Perpetuities. If not sooner terminated, the trusts of all shares under this indenture shall terminate upon the expiration of twenty-one (21) years next following the death of the last to die of the Donor and such of the issue of the Donor living as of the date of this trust indenture.18.	Retirement Plan Assets. Notwithstanding any other provision of this instrument, and except as provided in this paragraph, the Trustees may not distribute to or for the benefit of the Donor’s estate, any charity or any other nonindividual beneficiary, any benefits payable to this trust under any qualified retirement plan, individual retirement account or other retirement arrangement subject to the “minimum distribution rules” of Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, or other comparable provisions of law. It is the Donor’s intent that all such retirement benefits be distributed to or held for only individual beneficiaries, within the meaning of Section 401(a)(9) and applicable regulations. Accordingly, such benefits may not be used or applied for payment of debts, taxes or other claims against the Donor’s estate except to the minimum extent that would be required under applicable state or federal law in the absence of any specific provision on the subject in the Donor’s will or this trust. This paragraph shall not apply to any charitable bequest which is specifically directed to be funded with retirement benefits by other provisions of this instrument. Notwithstanding any other provision of this instrument or of state law, for purposes of distributing retirement plan assets, the class of the Donor’s issue shall not include an individual who is the Donor’s issue by virtue of legal adoption if such individual (i) was to adopted after the Donor’s Required Beginning Date or the Donor’s death, whichever occurs first, and (ii) is older than the oldest beneficiary of this trust who was a living member of the group consisting of the Donor’s issue on the earlier of those dates. The Donor’s Required Beginning Date, for purposes of this paragraph, means April 1 of the year following the year in which the Donor reaches age 70½, or, if later, the date on which this trust is first named as a beneficiary of any retirement plan, benefit or arrangement subject to the “minimum distribution rules” of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code.In witness whereof, the parties have set their hands on the day, month and year set out above.________________________________		__________________________________CLIENT NAME, Donor				CLIENT NAME, Trustee			_________________________________			_________________________________WITNESS						WITNESSCOMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS____________, ss.									              , 2016On this ___ day of ______________, 2016, before me, the undersigned notary public, personally appeared CLIENT NAME, proved to me through satisfactory evidence of identification, which was___________________, to be the person whose name is signed on the preceding document, and acknowledged to me that he signed it voluntarily for the stated purpose.      ______________________________	Notary Public 	My Commission Expires:	Page 1 of 10
